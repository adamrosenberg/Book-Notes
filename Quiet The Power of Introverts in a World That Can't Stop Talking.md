# Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking
**Susan Cain**
*April 2019*

Notice: I own or legally borrowed this book and took these notes to memorialize and further my learning. If you enjoyed these notes, **[please purchase the book here](https://amzn.to/2PRi7vr)** or borrow it from your local library.

## Intro
- Personality is the north-south of termperament. It affects exercise, conversation, conflict resolution, how you show love, learn from mistakes and lead people.
- The world idealizes non-shy extroverts, but introverts have a greater ability to focus, pay attention to details, and prepare than extroverts. 
- Being mild mannered lets you be more aggreessive while still seeming reasonable.
- Shyness and introversion are seperate (though often correlated). Shyness is about fear of rejections/ostracism, extra/intraversionis about mindset and social needs

## 1 The Extrovert Ideal
*The rise of the of the "mightly likable fellow".*
- Dale Carnegie was the beginning of fixation on extroversion. The ability to speak is an indispensible weapon — this seems to be a recurring theme through the history of Republican governments
- Before the 1920s people were gegarded for inner virtue to outer charm — to know what to say __and__ how to say it. We are seeing the logical outgrowth of the change today — morals are less important than attraction
- Gordon Allport - Ascendence-submission - we tend to place a premium on go-getters
- In the 1950s introversion was seen as maladaptive, especially shyness
- Scientists and technicians often struggle because they lack the ability to comminicate their ideas in the modern presentation format
- Pharmaceuticals were developed specifically to reduce social anxiety

## 2 The Myth of Charismatic Leadership
- Tony Robbins is crazy. The gist of his presentation is basically about having a positive mindset and to practice kindness. He combines it with high-energy (exciting) oratory
- Some organizations (e.g. Harvard) self-select for extroverts, even organizations that hire a lot of artists/designers/engineers (typical introvert types)
- The risk with extroverts is that they are good at getting their way, but that goesn't mean they're getting the right way. Quiet and loud people have roughly equal numbers of good ideas, but extroverts are better at getting ideas heard, so you'll get their ideas before an introverts' good idea.
- We consider those who speak more to be smarter, better looking, and more likable. Speaking more brings direct attention from the group, which increases power. Speaking first also implies competence
- *The Bus to Abrilene* - Everyone gets on the bus as a group dynamic, even though no one in the group actually wants to go to Abrilene. We have a tendency to follow those who initiate action (AR: I suspect that this is because following is a lower energy activity, and thus the path of least resistance.)
- Good introvert ideas are sometimes overlooked because the ideator is bad at presenting. Sometimes bad ideas are adobted because the presenter sells it well (AR: *[Monorail!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDOI0cq6GZM)*)
- Many of the best leaders are introverted and succeed by being more thoughtful companies don't need giant personalities to transform them. **They need leaders who build their institutions, not their egos** (AR: This goes for all organizations - govts included)
- The same principles are at play in evangelical churches. They hold up extraversion as a virtue and focus on very vocal worship. No room for quite liturgy, <vocab>contemplation</vocab> (AR: I wonder what the psychological impact of always having that noise going is. Quiet is important for contemplation and thought. Without that space, these people never spend time reflecting.)

## 3 When collaboration kills creativity
- Introverts work best like artists - alone with maximum focus.
- Collaboration can be useful in the macro (e.g. Woz at the Computer Club)
- The most creative people are socially poised introverts - interpersonally skilled, but not especially social. Independent/individualist.
- Solitude can be an innovation catalyst
- The world (i.e. educational institutions) cater to new groupthink focused on team skills. The web accelerated the thirst for collaboration
- Key missed detail - most open source wins were people collaborating online, but working in a solitary manner
- Solitary practice leads to growth. It's deliberate and appropriately challenging
- Process is more important than results (AR: Up to a point.)
- Open office plans are counter-productive for introverts
- Brainstorming works better individually than as a group exercise
- (AR) Groups are usually less than the sum of its' parts because members underperform for a variety of reasons:
  - Social loafing - These people are just there to chat in the first and last 5 minutes. They are not contributing anything.
  - Production blocking - Only 1 person can effectively talk at a time in a meeting. Generally everyone else is either straining to listen, thinking about their own thing, or looking at Facebook.
  - Evaluation apprehension - Basic fear of ridicule. People don't speak up because they don't want to feel stupid in front of their peers. (They said it would get better after High School!)
- **Asch experiment.** Demonstrated group conformity dyanmics. Some people will ignore their own observation of an event, in favor of the in-group explanation, in order to fit in with the group. Independent thinking is probably more energetically expensive

## 4 Is temperment destiny?
- Babies who are highly reactive to stimulus usually are introverted
- Personality is built on (in/ex)trovert temperament
- High-reactivity is based in the amygdala, which responds strongly to novelty. (fun fact: High-reactives also salivate more)
- Relationship is not absolute - there are social introverts and shy extroverts
- High-reactives generally think, feel and notice more deeply or in depth
- Kagan (book: Galen's Prophecy) posulates that blue eyes, allergies and (for men) thin, narrow features are correlated. (AR: No kidding.)
- Public speaking tiggers flights or fight; makes us feel as if we are exposed to predators
- *Orchid hypothesis* - **Highly-reactives are more strongly affected by both positive and negative experiences. It's a package deal.** 

## 5 Beyond Temperament
- Schwartz study - follow up study on Kagan's subjects. High/low reactivity did not change in adulthood. Some participants adapted better, but the physical patterns are still baked in.
- Free will exists within the confines of the genetic prison. 
- *Rubberband theory* - We can stretch our personalities, but only so far.
- Frontal cortex can calm the anxious amygdala. This is where routines help - they all the frontal cortex enough time to react in cutting off the amygdala before it flywheels.
- Stimulation tolerance is environmental. At a concert you are much more tolerant of of it than you would be in a library or a spa.
- With this knowledge, aim to create stimulation "sweet spots" - think of it like the mental equivalent of blood sugar - not too high, not too low.
- Introverted inflexibility can be a challenge when we are motivated to change. Strong convictions are more likely to drive success over time.

## 6 Franklin was a politician, but Eleanor spoke out of Conscience
- Dr. Aron; *Sensitivity* - similar to reactivity, but focuses on internal signals instead of physical response
- Eleanor Roosevelt was high sensitive, Franklin was an extrovert. ER was his conscience and was able to connect with people (on an emotional level) because of her empathy. FDR knew how to use the levers of government to fix the problems that Eleanor brought to his attention.
- High-sensitives are more responsive to others' moods, more cognizant of social norms
- Guilt has negative connotation, but guilt is teh basis of conscience
- "Functional, moderate guilt" may promote altruism (in the group); personal responsibility is an adaptive behavior (AR: to being told you are an irresponsible asshole)
- Having a bear is like drink a glass of extroversion
- High-sensitivity traits can make you more authentic — Blushing or sweating can provide "authenticity" social cues to validate your words. Increases synchronicity. (AR: If you sound excited, but your body language is reserved, our limbic system will notice something is off and you will have a 'gut feeling' that the person is decieving)
- Embarrassment is a moral emotion - it shows humility, modesty, non-aggression
- High-sensitivity trains survived genetically in the scholarly classes of ancient civiliations as a counterblaance to overly-risky chiefs during the hunter-gatherer stage. 
- Extroverts excel in good times, Introverts excel in bad times
- Introverts and Extroverts can balance each other as long as they share the same values
- Warrior Queens and Scholarly Advisors working together

## 7 Why did Wall Street creash and Warren Buffet prosper?
- (book) Richard Hofstadter: Anti-intellectualism in America
- Extroverts are more reward sensitive and less likely to heed warning signals
- Positive emotions are good in moderation, but can drive you to chase the "buzz" if you can't see the stop signs. No stop signs means high highs and low lows.
- The 2008 crash was caused by institutional buzz-chasing. Risk averse voices were marginalized as "gamblers" were continuously rewarded
- Reward-seeking can cause extroverts to speed up after a bad decision, trying to get a dopamine reward. This can accelerate desitute behavior
- Introverts and extroverts have similar intelligence distributions, but introverts will think more deeply and work more persistently on problems
- **Flow is an optimal state in which you feel totally engaged**
- Puruse activities for their own sake, not for a specific reward
  - *Why do you not sprint to do what you were born to do? - Marcus Aurelius*
- Flow often occurs when you become independent of environment such that you no longer respond exclusively to reward and punishment, because you have learned to self-reward
- **Stay true to your nature; find flow. It's your painting; be like Mi~~ke~~chelangelo**

## 8 Soft Power
- Asian culture is far more introverted than the West
  - This theme ties in well with the hotland/coldland scenario discussed in *21 Lessons for the 21st Century* about how cultural communication can be a massive issue
- If the idea is good, public opinion will (eventually) shift. **Soft power is quiet persistence.** Eventually you will attract followers

## 9 When should you act more extroverted than you really are?
- Dr. Brian Little [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYvXk_bqlBk)
- Free trait theory - we are genetically/culturally endowed with certain traits, but we can and do act out of character in service of "core, personal projects" (i.e. passion projects)
- Self-monitoring - modifying personal behavior based on real time social cues. Can help in social situations
- Create as many "restorative niches" as possible in sdaily life. Your happy place.
  - You should consider this in jobs or projects. Will this let me do things I am passionate about? Will it afford the lifestyle I want?  
- Free trait correlary - we will act out of character some of the time in exchange for being unapologetically in-character the rest of the time
- People who repress emotions tend to see their world colored by these emotions - it's a smoldering fire in their brain and they can't concieve that anyone else *wouldn't* be thinking those things. (AR: Gonna go with Republicans and homosexuality on this one)

## 10 The communication gap
  - Introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts; extroverts like competitors
  - Different cultures respond to shows of emotion differently (e.g. Filipinos vs. Israelis)
  - It's ok to hiss, it's not ok to bite. Ventin doesn't soothe anger, it fuels it (fire needs oxygen!)
  - Pay attention to the energy others exude. Tune into their radio station.

## 11 On Cobblers and Generals
  - This chapter was about kids, so I made a note to come back when I had some

## 12 Conclusion
  - Focus on developing deep, meaningful relationships
  - Put yourself in the right light. Solve problems, make art, think deeply
  - Figure out your purpose, find a path, accept the hardship, overcome, and celebrate!
