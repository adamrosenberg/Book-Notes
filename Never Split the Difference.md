*<p style="margin:30px 0; font-size:32px;">“How am I supposed to do that?”</p>*

## 1 The New Rules
* BATNA and ZOPA are intellectual/rational frameworks, which don't account for the counterparty's emotional needs, which will always take priority (same scientific rationale as Thinking Fast and Slow by Kahneman, type 1/2 systems; Methods of NVC by Rosenberg)
* Old school negotation involved give and take/horsetrading until everyone met unhappily in the middle
  * "If everyone leaves unhappy it's a good deal"
* Getting to Yes (Roger Fisher)
  * Thesis is that emotional brain can be overcome through rational, joint problem solving.
  * 4 basic tentants
    * Separate the person from the problem
    * Focus on their interest, not their current position
    * Work cooperatively to generate win-win options
    * Establish mutually-agreed standards for evaluating solutions.
  * Seems smart, appeals to rational people, but ignores human nature. Additionally, some people aren't rational (e.g. death by cop, Jim Jones, etc.)
* Framing Effect - A cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative connotations; e.g. as a loss or as a gain. People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.
* Prospect Loss Theory - People value losses more highly than gains (i.e. they will take greater measures to avert loss than to achieve gain) because losses cause a greater emotional impact (aversion to pain vs. thrill seeking)
* It all starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing.
* The whole concept, which you’ll learn as the centerpiece of this book, is called Tactical Empathy. This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person. Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity. It is the most active thing you can do.
* *Life is Negotation*
  * Most interactions boil down to "I want..."
  * Negotation is a means to gather information and influence behavior - communication with results.
  * Conflict is inevitable, so learning how to negotiate resolution is key 
  * Disarm, Rediect and Dismantle in a relationship-affirming way.
  * Negotiating does not mean browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing the emotional game that human society is set up for. In this world, you get what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. So claim your prerogative to ask for what you think is right.


## 2 Be A Mirror
* This chapter story is about a bank robbery where the main perp wanted to die by cop and the accomplices thought they were robbing an ATM.
* Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist. Experience will have taught them that they are best served by holding multiple hypotheses—about the situation, about the counterpart’s wants, about a whole array of variables—in their mind at the same time. Present and alert in the moment, they use all the new information that comes their way to test and winnow true hypotheses from false ones.
* Beware of overuse of personal pronouns (we/they, me/I) - the less important they make themself, the more important they probably are.
* We are easily distracted. We engage in selective listening, hearing only what we want to hear, our minds acting on a cognitive bias for consistency rather than truth. And that’s just the start.

   Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively. In one of the most cited research papers in psychology, George A. Miller persuasively put forth the idea that we can process only about seven pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment. In other words, we are easily overwhelmed. For those people who view negotiation as a battle of arguments, it’s the voices in their own head that are overwhelming them. When they’re not talking, they’re thinking about their arguments, and when they are talking, they’re making their arguments. Often those on both sides of the table are doing the same thing, so you have what I call a state of schizophrenia: everyone just listening to the voice in their head (and not well, because they’re doing seven or eight other things at the same time). It may look like there are only two people in a conversation, but really it’s more like four people all talking at once. 

   There’s one powerful way to quiet the voice in your head and the voice in their head at the same time: treat two schizophrenics with just one pill. **Instead of prioritizing your argument—in fact, instead of doing any thinking at all in the early goings about what you’re going to say—make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. In that mode of true active listening—aided by the tactics you’ll learn in the following chapters—you’ll disarm your counterpart.** You’ll make them feel safe. The voice in their head will begin to quiet down. The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want.
* Going too fast is a common mistake - if you are in too much of a hurry, people can feel that they are not being heard, and you risk undermining report and trust. **Time is your most valuable tool as a negotiator.**
### Voices
Your voice is the most powerful tool in any verbal communication. You can flip emotional switches with the tone and meter of your speech.
**Late Night FM DJ**
* Clam, smooth meter
* Slower pace
* Inflect voice downward at the end of sentences
  * Downward inflection indicates a period or that "you have it covered"
  * Upward inflection invites response and leaves the door open, like a question.
  * "Joe is gone, you are talking to me now" - with downward inflection, that is a statement of fact - not something open to being disputed

**Playful, Positive**
* Should be used most frequently
* Easy-going, good natured
* Light, engaging attitude
* Smile and relax, even on the phone
* Think Turkish market vendors
* Keep a smile on your face and you can push back and be assertive without coming off as threatening
* People tend to be more collaborative and think quicker when they are in a positive frame of mind (**insight: negativity is expensive**)

**Assertive/Direct**
* Basically pulling your dick out. Doesn't work well in negotiations, because it invites an aggressive response
* Use in response to aggression from the other party, or bad-faith actors.

### Mirroring
Also called isopraxism or imitation. It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which we copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice. It’s generally an unconscious behavior—we are rarely aware of it when it’s happening—but it’s a sign that people are bonding, in sync, and establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust. 
* Signals "we are alike, you can trust me" to the other party
* Often associated with body language, negotiators will mirrors words and nothing else - accent, tone, delivery, etc. Just the words.
  * For the FBI a mirror is when you repeat the last or critical (one to) three words of what someone has just said. This is the closest thing in the toolbox to a Jedi mindtrick.
  * Triggers a mirroring instinct and counterpart will inevitably elaborate on it, sustaining connection and revealing more potentially useful information.0
* For mirrors to be effective, you must have the patience to let it sit until the counterparty responds
* AR: He doesn't say it directly, but he suggest identifying Matcher types (Grant) as straight-shooters who you can engage in give-and-take with.  

### How to confront — and get your way — without confrontation
* Going at it with another pitbull is pointless, try this algorithm.
1. Late-night FM DJ Voice
2. Start with "I'm sorry..." 
3. Mirror.
4. Silence. At least 4 seconds to let the mirror work.
5. Repeat.

e.g. "Let's make two copies". "I'm sorry, two copies?" - gets them to elaborate on the request so you can repeat on the next level of detail. It's an indirect way of saying "I don't understand" without some angry white dude thinking you are a retard.

### Key Lessons        
* A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find.         
* Don’t commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them rigorously.
* People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible. 
* To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.
* Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard. You risk undermining the rapport and trust you’ve built. 
* Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart.
* There are three voice tones available to negotiators:         
  1. The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. When done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness. 
  2. The positive/playful voice: Should be your default voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking.
  3. The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely. Will cause problems and create pushback.
* Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.



## 3 Don't Feel Their Pain, Label It
* You can't separate the people from the problem when the problem is emotional. Once we get upset, rationality goes out the window. It's better to identify and influence.
* It may sound touchy-feely, but if you can perceive the emotions of others, you have a chance to turn them to your advantage. The more you know about someone, the more power you have.
* 'I didn’t give orders in my DJ voice, or ask what the fugitives wanted. Instead, I imagined myself in their place. “It looks like you don’t want to come out,” I said repeatedly. “It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we’ll come in with guns blazing. It looks like you don’t want to go back to jail.”'
* There is nothing more frustrating or disruptive to any negotiation than to get the feeling you are talking to someone who isn’t listening. Playing dumb is a valid negotiating technique, and “I don’t understand” is a legitimate response. But ignoring the other party’s position only builds up frustration and makes them less likely to do what you want. 

   The opposite of that is tactical empathy. 
   
   In my negotiating course, I tell my students that empathy is “the ability to recognize the perspective of a counterpart, and the vocalization of that recognition.” That’s an academic way of saying that empathy is paying attention to another human being, asking what they are feeling, and making a commitment to understanding their world. 
   
   Notice I didn’t say anything about agreeing with the other person’s values and beliefs or giving out hugs. That’s sympathy. What I’m talking about is trying to understand a situation from another person’s perspective. 
   
   One step beyond that is tactical empathy. 
   
   **Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow.** It’s bringing our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done. 
   
   *It’s emotional intelligence on steroids.*
### Labeling
* Now, pay close attention to exactly what we said: “It looks like you don’t want to come out. It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we’ll come in with guns blazing. It looks like you don’t want to go back to jail.” 
   
   We employed our tactical empathy by recognizing and then verbalizing the predictable emotions of the situation. We didn’t just put ourselves in the fugitives’ shoes. We spotted their feelings, turned them into words, and then very calmly and respectfully repeated their emotions back to them.
* In one brain imaging study, psychology professor Matthew Lieberman of the University of California, Los Angeles, found that when people are shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater activity in the amygdala, the part that generates fear. But **when they are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that govern rational thinking** (put the rider back in control of the elephant, Haigt). In other words, labeling an emotion—applying rational words to a fear—disrupts its raw intensity.
* Detecting the other person's emotional state based on words, music and dance (i.e. body language, tone & language - just like cold reading)
  * How do people respond to your words (or other external events)?
    * Mouths turning to frown, flat affect, fidgets tend to show distress or discomfort.
* Once detected, labels begin with "It seems/sounds/looks like...". Don't use *I* - it makes people defensive because you are focusing on yourself. Neutral tone invites your counterpart to be responsive.
* After labeling, use silence to give the other party an opportunity to affirm or refute the label (this is STRAIGHT out of NVC).
### Neutralize the Negative, Reinforce the Positive
* What good negotiators do when labeling is address those underlying emotions. Labeling negatives diffuses them (or defuses them, in extreme cases); labeling positives reinforces them.
* Don't ignore negative feelings, tease them out. They are fears - you have to confront them.
* Go directly at negative tynamics in a fearless, but deferential way. Admit your fault upfront and give an apology. The phrase "Look, I'm an asshole" can be amazingly effective at making problems go away.
  * Similarly, you can confront other negative emotions up front by leading off the conversation with labeling and addressing the issue in a non-judgemental way. E.g. instead of addressing the cranky behavior, address the underlying feelings like loneliness/sadness.
* (The picky woman giving to Girl Scouts) Fear of her money being misappropriated was the presenting dynamic that the first label uncovered. But the second label uncovered the underlying dynamic—her very presence in the office was driven by very specific memories of being a little Girl Scout and how it changed her life. 
   The obstacle here wasn’t finding the right match for the woman. It wasn’t that she was this highly finicky, hard-to-please donor. The real obstacle was that this woman needed to feel that she was understood, that the person handling her money knew why she was in that office and understood the memories that were driving her actions.

### Do An Accusation Audit
This is basically where you come up with all the bad things the other party might be feeling toward you (or *accuse* you of), and then open the conversation by acknowledging and labelling those things

**Vocab: Vituperative** - (adj.) bitter and abusive
### Key Lessons
* Imagine yourself in your counterpart’s situation. The beauty of empathy is that it doesn’t demand that you agree with the other person’s ideas (you may well find them crazy). But by acknowledging the other person’s situation, you immediately convey that you are listening. And once they know that you are listening, they may tell you something that you can use.
* The reasons why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they will make a deal, so focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement. Denying barriers or negative influences gives them credence; get them into the open.
* Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement, let it sink in. Don’t worry, the other party will fill the silence.
* Label your counterpart’s fears to diffuse their power. We all want to talk about the happy stuff, but remember, the faster you interrupt action in your counterpart’s amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear, the faster you can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust.
* List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can. Performing an accusation audit in advance prepares you to head off negative dynamics before they take root. And because these accusations often sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true. 
* Remember you’re dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood. So use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics.


## 4 Beware "Yes" — Master "No"
Yes and Maybe are often worthless, becuase they end the conversation, but don't actually create a tangible commitment. No is better than anything except a Yes with a firm commitment, because it moves the conversation along, reveals more information and adjusts the course toward one that ends in a Committed Yes.

* “No” is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it. We’ve been conditioned to fear the word “No.” But it is a statement of perception far more often than of fact. It seldom means, “I have considered all the facts and made a rational choice.” Instead, “No” is often a decision, frequently temporary, to maintain the status quo. Change is scary, and “No” provides a little protection from that scariness.
* This means you have to train yourself to hear “No” as something other than rejection, and respond accordingly. When someone tells you “No,” you need to rethink the word in one of its alternative—and much more real—meanings:        
  * I am not yet ready to agree;
  * You are making me feel uncomfortable;
  * I do not understand;
  * I don’t think I can afford it;
  * I want something else;
  * I need more information; or
  * I want to talk it over with someone else.
* I’ll let you in on a secret. There are actually three kinds of “Yes”: Counterfeit, Confirmation, and Commitment.
  * Fake Yes to get out of the conversation
  * Non-committal affirmation in response to a direct question
  * A committed yes that is followed by action
* Humans are often so used to pushing for Yes that they wind up getting a counterfit one because they push before the counterparty is emotionally ready.
* In every negotiation the result comes from someone else's decision. We can't control them, but we can influence them by inhabiting their world and relating to them in those terms.
  * It starts with base needs - safety and autonomy/control
  * You can't logically convince someone they are safe or in control, they are illogical, primal urges. If you argue them into a corner, you will get a counterfit Yes as an escape valve
  * Being fake nice also fails because it's blatantly manuplative and will trigger anyone who has been manipulated before (e.g. everyone over the age of 5)
  * Ditto with going for an early yes - people are used to bullshit, high-pressure sales tactics and they'll shut down or find a way to escape.
  * Instead we get there by asking for "No". It gives the speaker a feeling of safety and control. Overtime, these feelings of safety and control will free them to giving a Committed Yes.
* Marti is an FBI employee who had a dick boss that felt threatened. She asked if he wanted the FBI to be embarrassed, and when he said no, she asked him what he wanted her to do.
  * When I heard Marti do that, I was like, “Bang!” By pushing for a “No,” Marti nudged her supervisor into a zone where he was making the decisions. And then she furthered his feelings of safety and power with a question inviting him to define her next move. The important thing here is that Marti not only accepted the “No”; she searched it out and embraced it.
* “No” is not failure. Used strategically it’s an answer that opens the path forward. Getting to the point where you’re no longer horrified by the word “No” is a liberating moment that every negotiator needs to reach. Because if your biggest fear is “No,” you can’t negotiate. You’re the hostage of “Yes.” You’re handcuffed. You’re done. 
   So let’s undress “No.” It’s a reaffirmation of autonomy. It is not a use or abuse of power; it is not an act of rejection; it is not a manifestation of stubbornness; it is not the end of the negotiation.
   
   In fact, “No” often opens the discussion up. The sooner you say “No,” the sooner you’re willing to see options and opportunities that you were blind to previously. Saying “No” often spurs people to action because they feel they’ve protected themselves and now see an opportunity slipping away.
* "No":
  * allows the real issues to be brought forth;
  * protects people from making-and lets them correct-ineffective decisions;
  * slows things down so that people can freely embrace their decisions and the agreements they enter into;
  * helps people feel safe, secure, emotionally comfortable, and in control of their decisions; 
  * moves everyone's efforts forward.
* "Every 'No' gets me closer to a 'Yes'." -Mark Cuban
* There is a big difference between making your counterpart feel that they can say “No” and actually getting them to say it. Sometimes, if you’re talking to somebody who is just not listening, the only way you can crack their cranium is to antagonize them into “No.” 
   One great way to do this is to mislabel one of the other party’s emotions or desires. You say something that you know is totally wrong, like “So it seems that you really are eager to leave your job” when they clearly want to stay. That forces them to listen and makes them comfortable correcting you by saying, “No, that’s not it. This is it.” 
   Another way to force “No” in a negotiation is to ask the other party what they don’t want. “Let’s talk about what you would say ‘No’ to,” you’d say. And people are comfortable saying “No” here because it feels like self-protection. And once you’ve gotten them to say “No,” people are much more open to moving forward toward new options and ideas.
* Email Magic: Provoke a response with a one-sentence (subject line) email - "Have you given up on this project?"
### Key Lessons
* By turning niceness into a lubricant, we’ve leeched it of meaning. A smile and a nod might signify “Get me out of here!” as much as it means “Nice to meet you.” 
  That’s death for a good negotiator, who gains their power by understanding their counterpart’s situation and extracting information about their counterpart’s desires and needs. Extracting that information means getting the other party to feel safe and in control. And while it may sound contradictory, the way to get there is by getting the other party to disagree, to draw their own boundaries, to define their desires as a function of what they do not want.
* As you try to put the chapter’s methods to use, I encourage you to think of them as the anti–“niceness ruse.” Not in the sense that they are unkind, but in the sense that they are authentic. Triggering “No” peels away the plastic falsehood of “Yes” and gets you to what’s really at stake. Along the way, keep in mind these powerful lessons:
  * Break the habit of attempting to get people to say “yes.” Being pushed for “yes” makes people defensive. Our love of hearing “yes” makes us blind to the defensiveness we ourselves feel when someone is pushing us to say it. 
  * “No” is not a failure. We have learned that “No” is the anti-“Yes” and therefore a word to be avoided at all costs. But it really often just means “Wait” or “I’m not comfortable with that.” Learn how to hear it calmly. It is not the end of the negotiation, but the beginning.
  * “Yes” is the final goal of a negotiation, but don’t aim for it at the start. Asking someone for “Yes” too quickly in a conversation—“Do you like to drink water, Mr. Smith?”—gets his guard up and paints you as an untrustworthy salesman.
  * Saying “No” makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they don’t want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you. That’s why “Is now a bad time to talk?” is always better than “Do you have a few minutes to talk?” 
  * Sometimes the only way to get your counterpart to listen and engage with you is by forcing them into a “No.” That means intentionally mislabeling one of their emotions or desires or asking a ridiculous question—like, “It seems like you want this project to fail”—that can only be answered negatively. 
  * Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don’t beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. It’s not about you. 
  * If a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise “No”-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. “Have you given up on this project?” works wonders.

## 5 Trigger the Two Words that Immediately Transform Any Negotiation
* CNU developed what is a powerful staple in the high-stakes world of crisis negotiation, the Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM). **The model proposes five stages—active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral change—that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior.** The origins of the model can be traced back to the great American psychologist Carl Rogers, who proposed that real change can only come when a therapist accepts the client as he or she is—an approach known as unconditional positive regard. The vast majority of us, however, as Rogers explained, come to expect that love, praise, and approval are dependent on saying and doing the things people (initially, our parents) consider correct. That is, because for most of us the positive regard we experience is conditional, we develop a habit of hiding who we really are and what we really think, instead calibrating our words to gain approval but disclosing little. (Which is why so few social interactions lead to actual behavior change - people say things they don't mean to gain approval, but lack of belief precludes followthrough.)
* **"That's right"** is a magic phrase in negotiations that signals you can proceed from a deadlock. The counterparty has been heard and feels understood.
* Driving toward "That's Right" is a winning strategy in all negotations. But hearing "you're right" is a disaster. "You're Right" is something people say to get you to go away - it's a fake yes.
### Key Lessons
* The power of getting to that understanding, and not to some simple “yes,” is revelatory in the art of negotiation. The moment you’ve convinced someone that you truly understand her dreams and feelings (the whole world that she inhabits), mental and behavioral change becomes possible, and the foundation for a breakthrough has been laid. Use these lessons to lay that foundation:
  * Creating unconditional positive regard opens the door to changing thoughts and behaviors. Humans have an innate urge toward socially constructive behavior. The more a person feels understood, and positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely that urge for constructive behavior will take hold.
  * “That’s right” is better than “yes.” Strive for it. Reaching “that’s right” in a negotiation creates breakthroughs. 
  * Use a summary to trigger a “that’s right.” The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing. Identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm “the world according to . . .”

## 6 Bend Their Reality
* The real problem with compromise is that it has come to be known as this great concept, in relationships and politics and everything else. Compromise, we are told quite simply, is a sacred moral good.

   I’m here to call bullshit on compromise right now. **We don’t compromise because it’s right; we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face.** We compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie. Distilled to its essence, we compromise to be safe. Most people in a negotiation are driven by fear or by the desire to avoid pain. Too few are driven by their actual goals.

   *So don’t settle and—here’s a simple rule—never split the difference.* Creative solutions are almost always preceded by some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflict. Accommodation and compromise produce none of that. You’ve got to embrace the hard stuff. That’s where the great deals are. And that’s what great negotiators do.
* Time is one of the most crucial variables in any negotiation. The simple passing of time and its sharper cousin, the deadline, are the screw that pressures every deal to a conclusion.

   Whether your deadline is real and absolute or merely a line in the sand, it can trick you into believing that doing a deal now is more important than getting a good deal. Deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive things that are against their best interests, because we all have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches. 
   
   What good negotiators do is force themselves to resist this urge and take advantage of it in others. It’s not so easy. Ask yourself: What is it about a deadline that causes pressure and anxiety? The answer is consequences; the perception of the loss we’ll incur in the future—“The deal is off!” our mind screams at us in some imaginary future scenario—should no resolution be achieved by a certain point in time.
* Deadlines are the bogeymen of negotiation, almost exclusively self-inflicted figments of our imagination, unnecessarily unsettling us for no good reason. The mantra we coach our clients on is, “No deal is better than a bad deal.” If that mantra can truly be internalized, and clients begin to believe they’ve got all the time they need to conduct the negotiation right, their patience becomes a formidable weapon.
* Deadlines cut both ways. Cohen may well have been nervous about what his boss would say if he left Japan without an agreement. But it’s also true that Cohen’s counterparts wouldn’t have won if he’d left without a deal. **That’s the key: When the negotiation is over for one side, it’s over for the other too.**
* “If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you’re wrong,” I say. “That’s not empathy; that’s projection.”
* In *Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain*, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explained a groundbreaking discovery he made. Studying people who had damage in the part of the brain where emotions are generated, he found that they all had something peculiar in common: They couldn’t make decisions. They could describe what they should do in logical terms, but they found it impossible to make even the simplest choice. In other words, while we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is governed by emotion.
### The F-Word: Why it's so powerful, when to use it and how
**The most powerful word in negotiations is "Fair".**
* Imaging shows that fairness is regulated in the emotional center of the brain, not the rational center.
* 3 uses of Fair:
  * Judo-defensive usage - Most common - used to destabilize/shock the otherside. Not always intentional, sometimes borne of frustration. Counter: The other side may just be overwhelmed and lashing out. Slow it down, apologize, and get to their needs.
  * Redirection - Used to disarm a request from the counterparty by instead focusing on their understanding of fairness instead of the request itself. Counter: Mirror them - "Fair?" <pause> "It seems like you are ready to provide evidence to support that..."
  * Constructive - The last use of the F-word is my favorite because it’s positive and constructive. It sets the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation. Here’s how I use it: Early on in a negotiation, I say, “I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I’m being unfair, and we’ll address it.”
* A few years ago, I stumbled upon the book How to Become a Rainmaker, and I like to review it occasionally to refresh my sense of the emotional drivers that fuel decisions. The book does a great job to explain the sales job not as a rational argument, but as an emotional framing job.

   **If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and unmet objectives—if you can get at what people are really buying—then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution.**
* By far the best theory for describing the principles of our irrational decisions is something called Prospect Theory. Created in 1979 by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, prospect theory describes how people choose between options that involve risk, like in a negotiation. The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. That’s called the Certainty Effect. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That’s called Loss Aversion.
* It's not enough to show the other party that you can deliver what they want — to get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.
  1. Anchor their emotions.
  To bend your counterpart's reality, you have to start with the basics of empathy. So start out with an accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other side’s loss aversion so that they’ll jump at the chance to avoid it. Counter: As established thus far, **there is no counter to making other people feel emotionally heard**.

  2. Let the other person go first...most of the time.
  Going first opens you up to leaving money on the table, because you may anchor below your counterparty's upper limit. That said, the risk is that you must be prepared to psychically withstand that offer. If the other person is a pro, they will be anchoring extremely low to try and bend your reality. Counter: If you are facing a rookie, or know the market well-enough to know your value, then it makes sense to go first to set your anchor appropriately high.

  3. Establish a range
  When you are confronted with naming your price, counter by recalling a similar deal that establishes a ballpark - "At places like X, people in this position get between $XXX and $XYY."

  4. Pivot to nonmonetary terms
  Financial terms don't exist in isolation. If the counterparty can't come up on the financial terms, see if they can offer nonmonetary terms that have a low cost for them, but high value to you. E.g. Social Media/Email list shoutouts/adverts. Additionally, if you offer up something non-monetary it can signal to a low-information counterparty that you are exhausted monetarily.

  5. When you do talk numbers, use odd ones
  The biggest thing to remember is that numbers that end in 0 inevitably feel like temporary placeholders, guesstimates that you can easily be negotiated off of. But anything you throw out that sounds less rounded—say, $37,263—feels like a figure that you came to as a result of thoughtful calculation. Such numbers feel serious and permanent to your counterpart, so use them to fortify your offers.

  6. Surprise with a gift
  Unexpected conciliatory gestures are hugely effective because they introduce a dynamic called reciprocity (again, fairness is emotional); the other party feels the need to answer you generosity in kind. 
* Be patient - at the moment you re-arrange their reality, there will be a bit of pause as they process it
### How to negotiate a better salary
1. Be pleasantly persistent on nonsalary terms
The more you talk about nonsalary terms, the more likely you are to hear the full range of their options. If they can't meet those options, they may opt to offer more cash instead.
2. Salary terms without success terms is Russian roulette
Once you've negotiated a salary, define success - as well as KPI for your next raise.
3. Spark their interest in your success and gain an (un)official mentor
When you sell yourself to the boss, you are also offering them a chance to validate their own intelligence and skill in hiring talent. Making them your rabbi invests them in your success and part of their ego. Ask: "What does it take to be successful here (or in this role)".
### Key Lessons
As you work these tools into your daily life, remember the following powerful lessons:
  * All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs. Don’t let yourself be fooled by the surface. Once you know that the Haitian kidnappers just want party money, you will be miles better prepared.
  * Splitting the difference is wearing one black and one brown shoe, so don’t compromise. Meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides.
  * Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiating process and do impulsive things that are against their best interests.
  * The F-word—“Fair”—is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the other side on the defensive and gain concessions. When your counterpart drops the F-bomb, don’t get suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to explain how you’re mistreating them.
  * You can bend your counterpart’s reality by anchoring his starting point. Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be. When you get to numbers, set an extreme anchor to make your “real” offer seem reasonable, or use a range to seem less aggressive. The real value of anything depends on what vantage point you’re looking at it from. 
  * People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. Make sure your counterpart sees that there is something to lose by inaction.


## 7 Create the Illusion
* All negotiation, done well, should be an information-gathering process that vests your counterpart in an outcome that serves you.
* (After one drug dealer casually asks another for proof of life, and the kidnapper offers to put the victim on the phone "for free") 
  * That’s when I had my “Holy shit!” moment and realized that this is the technique I’d been waiting for. Instead of asking some closed-ended question with a single correct answer, he’d asked an open-ended, yet calibrated one that forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how to solve the problem. I thought to myself, This is perfect! It’s a natural and normal question, not a request for a fact. It’s a “how” question, and “how” engages because “how” asks for help.
  * The best part is, he doesn't own the kidnapper anything, the kidnapper thinks it was his idea. **The secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control.**
  * The genius of this technique is really well explained by something that the psychologist Kevin Dutton says in his book Split-Second Persuasion.1 He talks about what he calls “unbelief,” which is active resistance to what the other side is saying, complete rejection. That’s where the two parties in a negotiation usually start. 
     
     If you don’t ever get off that dynamic, you end up having showdowns, as each side tries to impose its point of view. You get two hard skulls banging against each other, like in Dos Palmas. But if you can get the other side to drop their unbelief, you can slowly work them to your point of view on the back of their energy, just like the drug dealer’s question got the kidnapper to volunteer to do what the drug dealer wanted. You don’t directly persuade them to see your ideas. Instead, you ride them to your ideas. As the saying goes, the best way to ride a horse is in the direction in which it is going.
* "He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation." Robert Estabrook
* Calibrated questions are not just random requests for comment. They have a direction: once you figure out where you want a conversation to go, you have to design the questions that will ease the conversation in that direction while letting the other guy think it’s his choice to take you there. 
   That’s why I refer to these questions as calibrated questions. You have to calibrate them carefully, just like you would calibrate a gun sight or a measuring scale, to target a specific problem.
   * Calibrated questions avoid verbs or words like: can, is, are, do, does. These are closed-ended questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no. Instead, they start with a list of words people know as reporter's questions: who, what, when, where, why and how. Those words inspire your counterpart to think and then speak expansively.
   * It's best to start with what, how and *rarely* why. Who, when and where get you facts with no thinking. 
   * Why can backfire because it's interpreted as accusatory in every language, so you only want to use it when accusatory is appropriate as a judoka - e.g. "Why would you ever change from the way you've always done things?"
   * What and How are logical/rational brain, layer/system 2 type questions.
   * You should use calibrated questions early and often, and there are a few that you will find that you will use in the beginning of nearly every negotiation. “What is the biggest challenge you face?” is one of those questions. It just gets the other side to teach you something about themselves, which is critical to any negotiation because all negotiation is an information-gathering process. Here are some other great standbys that I use in almost every negotiation, depending on the situation:
    * ​What about this is important to you?
    * ​How can I help to make this better for us?
    * How would you like me to proceed?
    * ​What is it that brought us into this situation?
    * ​How can we solve this problem?
    * What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?
    * ​How am I supposed to do that?
* The first and most basic rule of keeping your emotional cool is to bite your tongue. Not literally, of course. But you have to keep away from knee-jerk, passionate reactions. Pause. Think. Let the passion dissipate. That allows you to collect your thoughts and be more circumspect in what you say. It also lowers your chance of saying more than you want to.
* Another simple rule is, when you are verbally assaulted, do not counterattack. Instead, disarm your counterpart by asking a calibrated question. The next time a waiter or salesclerk tries to engage you in a verbal skirmish, try this out. I promise you it will change the entire tenor of the conversation.
### Key Lessons 
Who has control in a conversation, the guy listening or the guy talking? 

The listener, of course. 

That’s because the talker is revealing information while the listener, if he’s trained well, is directing the conversation toward his own goals. He’s harnessing the talker’s energy for his own ends. 

When you try to work the skills from this chapter into your daily life, remember that these are listener’s tools. They are not about strong-arming your opponent into submission. Rather, they’re about using the counterpart’s power to get to your objective. They’re listener’s judo. As you put listener’s judo into practice, remember the following powerful lessons:
* ​Don’t try to force your opponent to admit that you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation.
* Avoid questions that can be answered with “Yes” or tiny pieces of information. These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity; you will be expected to give something back.
* ​Ask calibrated questions that start with the words “How” or “What.” By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will give your counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire them to speak at length, revealing important information.
* ​Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in any language.
* Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart toward solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend their energy on devising a solution.
* ​Bite your tongue. When you’re attacked in a negotiation, pause and avoid angry emotional reactions. Instead, ask your counterpart a calibrated question.
* ​There is always a team on the other side. If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable.

## 8 Guarantee Execution
*It only takes one bit player to screw up a deal.*
* Your job as a negotiator isn’t just to get to an agreement. It’s getting to one that can be implemented and making sure that happens. Negotiators have to be decision architects: they have to dynamically and adaptively design the verbal and nonverbal elements of the negotiation to gain both consent and execution.
* The trick to “How” questions is that, correctly used, they are gentle and graceful ways to say “No” and guide your counterpart to develop a better solution—your solution. A gentle How/No invites collaboration and leaves your counterpart with a feeling of having been treated with respect.
* As Julie did, the first and most common “No” question you’ll use is some version of “How am I supposed to do that?” (for example, “How can we raise that much?”). Your tone of voice is critical as this phrase can be delivered as either an accusation or a request for assistance. So pay attention to your voice. 

   **This question tends to have the positive effect of making the other side take a good look at your situation. This positive dynamic is what I refer to as “forced empathy,” and it’s especially effective if leading up to it you’ve already been empathic with your counterpart.** This engages the dynamic of reciprocity to lead them to do something for you. Starting with José’s kidnapping, “How am I supposed to do that?” became our primary response to a kidnapper demanding a ransom. And we never had it backfire.
* Right then I knew we had the right tool. It was exactly the opposite of the Burnham case, where our negotiator cut the deal with one of the guys and then the rest of them took the $300,000 and said, “No, we’re not doing that.” **Causing the other side to work that hard and forcing that much internal coordination in service of our own goals was unprecedented.** (AR: It's like Star Trek where the Vulcans made all the humans get along before they'd negotiate)
* The larger concept I’m explaining here is that in any negotiation you have to analyze the entire negotiation space. 
   When other people will be affected by what is negotiated and can assert their rights or power later on, it’s just stupid to consider only the interests of those at the negotiation table. You have to beware of “behind the table” or “Level II” players—that is, parties that are not directly involved but who can help implement agreements they like and block ones they don’t. You can’t disregard them even when you’re talking to a CEO. There could always be someone whispering into his ear. At the end of the day, the deal killers often are more important than the deal makers. 
   
   Think back to the prison siege: it was almost ruined because one bit player on our side was not totally on board. That’s what our use of calibrated questions in Ecuador avoided, and that’s why José’s case was a home run. 
   
   It only takes one bit player to screw up a deal.

### SPOTTING LIARS, DEALING WITH JERKS, AND CHARMING EVERYONE ELSE
* In two famous studies on what makes us like or dislike somebody, UCLA psychology professor Albert Mehrabian created *the 7-38-55 rule*. That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face.
  * So how do you use this rule? First, pay very close attention to tone and body language to make sure they match up with the literal meaning of the words. If they don’t align, it’s quite possible that the speaker is lying or at least unconvinced. 
  
  When someone’s tone of voice or body language does not align with the meaning of the words they say, use labels to discover the source of the incongruence.
  * Use labels to discover the source of the incongruence.
* *The Rule of Three* is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. It’s tripling the strength of whatever dynamic you’re trying to drill into at the moment. In doing so, it uncovers problems before they happen. It’s really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction. Great for avoiding a counterfit yes.
  * The answer, I learned, is to vary your tactics. The first time they agree to something or give you a commitment, that’s No. 1. For No. 2 you might label or summarize what they said so they answer, “That’s right.” And No. 3 could be a calibrated “How” or “What” question about implementation that asks them to explain what will constitute success, something like “What do we do if we get off track?” 
  * Or the three times might just be the same calibrated question phrased three different ways, like “What’s the biggest challenge you faced? What are we up against here? What do you see as being the most difficult thing to get around?”
* In a study of the components of lying, Harvard Business School professor Deepak Malhotra and his coauthors found that, **on average, liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns**. They start talking about him, her, it, one, they, and their rather than I, in order to put some distance between themselves and the lie.

   And they discovered that liars tend to speak in more complex sentences in an attempt to win over their suspicious counterparts. It’s what W. C. Fields meant when he talked about baffling someone with bullshit. The researchers dubbed this *the Pinocchio Effect* because, just like Pinocchio’s nose, **the number of words grew along with the lie**. People who are lying are, understandably, more worried about being believed, so they work harder—too hard, as it were—at being believable. (AR: Conversely, anyone who is concerned about credibility might use more words)
* The use of pronouns by a counterpart can also help give you a feel for their actual importance in the decision and implementation chains on the other side of the table. The more in love they are with “I,” “me,” and “my” the less important they are.
* People are weary of slick salesmen using their name. Instead, try throwing them off a bit by using your own name. E.g. The Chris Discount. **Humanize yourself. Use your name to introduce yourself. Say it in a fun, friendly way. Let them enjoy the interaction, too.** 

### How to get your counterparts to bid against themselves
* We’ve found that you can usually express “No” four times before actually saying the word.
  1. How am I supposed to do that? (delivered in a deferential way, as a request for help)
  2. Your offer is very generous. I'm sorry, that just doesn't work for me.
  3. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I just can't do that.
  4. I'm sorry, no.
  5. No.
  6. NO!
* The art of closing a deal is staying focused to the very end. There are crucial points at the finale when you must draw on your mental discipline. Don’t think about what time the last flight leaves, or what it would be like to get home early and play golf. Do not let your mind wander. Remain focused.
### Key Lessons
* Superstar negotiators—real rainmakers—know that a negotiation is a playing field beneath the words, where really getting to a good deal involves detecting and manipulating subtle, nonobvious signals beneath the surface. It is only by visualizing and modifying these subsurface issues that you can craft a great deal and make sure that it is implemented. As you put the following tools to use, remember this chapter’s most important concept. That is, “Yes” is nothing without “How.” Asking “How,” knowing “How,” and defining “How” are all part of the effective negotiator’s arsenal. He would be unarmed without them.
* ​Ask calibrated “How” questions, and ask them again and again. Asking “How” keeps your counterparts engaged but off balance. Answering the questions will give them the illusion of control. It will also lead them to contemplate your problems when making their demands.
* Use “How” questions to shape the negotiating environment. You do this by using “How can I do that?” as a gentle version of “No.” This will subtly push your counterpart to search for other solutions—your solutions. And very often it will get them to bid against themselves.
* ​Don’t just pay attention to the people you’re negotiating with directly; always identify the motivations of the players “behind the table.” You can do so by asking how a deal will affect everybody else and how on board they are.
* ​Follow the 7-38-55 Percent Rule by paying close attention to tone of voice and body language. Incongruence between the words and nonverbal signs will show when your counterpart is lying or uncomfortable with a deal.
* ​Is the “Yes” real or counterfeit? Test it with the Rule of Three: use calibrated questions, summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to reaffirm their agreement at least three times. It’s really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction.
* A person’s use of pronouns offers deep insights into his or her relative authority. If you’re hearing a lot of “I,” “me,” and “my,” the real power to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking up a lot of “we,” “they,” and “them,” it’s more likely you’re dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options open.
* ​Use your own name to make yourself a real person to the other side and even get your own personal discount. Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove roadblocks.

## 9 Bargain Hard
* 3 types of negotiators (It's a spectrum)
  1. Analyst
    * Methodical, diligent 
    * Not in a rush, believe in working systematically without much regard to time. 
    * Values minimizing mistakes. Tend to be more cool and distant instead o fsoothing, putting people off and limiting them from opening counterparts up. 
    * Reserved problem solvers, info aggregators, hyper-sensitive to reciprocity. (MATCHERS) 
    * Skeptical by nature - don't overwhelm with questions. They won't answer until they know why you are asking.
    * Appeal to them with data/logic and focus on facts. Avoid suprises.
    * Silence is an opportunity to think - they aren't mad at you, nor do they want you to talk more.
    * Apologies have little value to them since they see the negotiation and their relationship with you as a person largely as separate things. They respond fairly well in the moment to labels. They are not quick to answer calibrated questions, or closed-ended questions when the answer is “Yes.” They may need a few days to respond.
    * If you’re an analyst you should be worried about cutting yourself off from an essential source of data, your counterpart. The single biggest thing you can do is to smile when you speak. People will be more forthcoming with information to you as a result. Smiling can also become a habit that makes it easy for you to mask any moments you’ve been caught off guard.
  2. Accommodator
    * Values relationship and relationship building. Goal is to be on great terms with counterparty. Loves win-wins.
    * Time is well spent as long as communication and information is flowing freely. 
    * Sociable, peace-seeking, optimistic, distractible, poor time managers
    * Appeals to them by being sociable and friendly. Listen to them talk and ask calibrated questions to focus them where you want the conversation to go.
    * May have a tendency to overpromise in order to get you to like them, can be underprepared because they care more about appealing to you. (GIVERS)
    * Uncovering objections can be difficult, becuase they fear the conflict that may arrise.
    * If you are an Accommodator, stick to being likable, but don't sacrifice your objections. Be conscious of excess chitchat.
  3. Assertive
    * Believes time is money. Self-image is linked to how much they can accomplish in a given period of time. Done is better than perfect.
    * Winning > everything, often at the expense of others
    * Direct and candid to a fault. Aggressive communication style that doesn't consider future itneractions. Relationships are based on respect, nothing else.
    * Best to focus on what they have to say, because they won't listen until they are convinced you understand them.
    * To an Assertive, every silence is an opportunity to speak more. Mirrors are a wonderful tool with this type. So are calibrated questions, labels, and summaries. The most important thing to get from an Assertive will be a “that’s right” that may come in the form of a “that’s it exactly” or “you hit it on the head.”
    * When it comes to reciprocity, this group tend to be TAKERS. They will believe they deserve whatever has been given to them, so there is no expectation that they owe in return. Will always be looking for opportunity to get more, or to get something in return in the instance they do give.
    * If you are an Assertive, be conscious of tone — you won't intend to be overly harsh, but you will often come off that way. Intentionally soften your tone and work to make it more pleasant. Use calibrated questions and labels iwht your counter part, which will make you rmore approachable and increase the chances for collaboration.
* The greatest obstacle to accurately identifying someone else’s style is what I call the “I am normal” paradox. That is, our hypothesis that the world should look to others as it looks to us. 
  * Thinking you’re normal is one of the most damaging assumptions in negotiations. With it, we unconsciously project our own style on the other side. But with three types of negotiators in the world, there’s a 66 percent chance your counterpart has a different style than yours. A different “normal.”
  * Don’t treat others the way you want to be treated; treat them the way they need to be treated.
### Punching Back: Using assertion without getting used by it
*Sometimes, you just need to shake things up and punch the other side in the face.*
1. Real anger, threats without anger, and strategic umbrage
   Anger shows passion and conviction, which can be persuasive. It can also make your counterpart more sensitive, making them less cooperative and commital. 
   
   When a counterparty makes a ridiculous offer that angers you, calm yourself and respond to the proposal, not the person. E.g. "I don't see how that would ever work."

   Well timed offense taking (strategic umbrage) can wake your counterpart to the problem. Threats delivered without anger, but with poise, are great tools.
2. "Why" questions
   Only use why questions to knock someone back. It's an iffy technique though. The goal is to trigger your counterpart to defend their position, when defending that position may lead them to a conclusion that you want them to reach.
3. "I" Messages
   Using I is a good way to set a boundary without escalation. This is traditionally used to step out of a bad dynamic, like counteracting unproductive statements. E.g. I feel ___ when you ___ because ____." (i.e. NVC technique). Be mindful that your tone isn't aggressive - it must be cool and level.
4. No neediness: Having the ready-to-walk mindset
   **No deal is better than a bad deal. If you can't walk away then you have taken yourself hostage. Know your bottom line, be willing to walk, and never be needy for a deal.**

* Before we move on, I want to emphasize how important it is to maintain a collaborative relationship even when you’re setting boundaries. Your response must always be expressed in the form of strong, yet empathic, limit-setting boundaries—that is, tough love—not as hatred or violence. Anger and other strong emotions can on rare occasions be effective. But only as calculated acts, never a personal attack. In any bare-knuckle bargaining session, the most vital principle to keep in mind is never to look at your counterpart as an enemy. 
   
   The person across the table is never the problem. The unsolved issue is. So focus on the issue. This is one of the most basic tactics for avoiding emotional escalations. Our culture demonizes people in movies and politics, which creates the mentality that if we only got rid of the person then everything would be okay. But this dynamic is toxic to any negotiation.

### Ackerman Bargaining
The Ackerman model is an offer-counteroffer method, at least on the surface. But it is a very effective system for beating the usual lackluster bargaining dynamic, which has the predictable result of meeting in the middle. The systematized and easy-to-remember process has only four steps: 

1. ​Set your target price (your goal). 
2. ​Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price. 
3.​ Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent). 
4. ​Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer. 
5. ​When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight. 
6. ​On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit. 

* The genius of this system is that it incorporates the psychological tactics we’ve discussed—reciprocity, extreme anchors, loss aversion, and so on—without you needing to think about them.
* Intial offer is an extreme anchor. You drop in progressive increases sparingly, after the counterpart has made offers, and you've thrown out a few calibrated questions to try and get them to auto-bid.

### Key Lessons
Top negotiators know, however, that conflict is often the path to great deals. And the best find ways to actually have fun engaging in it. Conflict brings out truth, creativity, and resolution. So the next time you find yourself face-to-face with a bare-knuckle bargainer, remember the lessons in this chapter. 
  * ​Identify your counterpart’s negotiating style. Once you know whether they are Accommodator, Assertive, or Analyst, you’ll know the correct way to approach them.
  * ​Prepare, prepare, prepare. When the pressure is on, you don’t rise to the occasion; you fall to your highest level of preparation. So design an ambitious but legitimate goal and then game out the labels, calibrated questions, and responses you’ll use to get there. That way, once you’re at the bargaining table, you won’t have to wing it.
  * Get ready to take a punch. Kick-ass negotiators usually lead with an extreme anchor to knock you off your game. If you’re not ready, you’ll flee to your maximum without a fight. So prepare your dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into the compromise trap.
  * Set boundaries, and learn to take a punch or punch back, without anger. The guy across the table is not the problem; the situation is.
  * Prepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into the weeds of bargaining, you’ll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100 percent. Decreasing raises and ending on nonround numbers will get your counterpart to believe that he’s squeezing you for all you’re worth when you’re really getting to the number you want.

## 10 Find the Black Swan
**Black Swan theory tells us that things happen that were previously thought to be impossible—or never thought of at all. This is not the same as saying that sometimes things happen against one-in-a-million odds, but rather that things never imagined do come to pass.**
* In every negotiating session, there are different kinds of information. There are those things we know, like our counterpart’s name and their offer and our experiences from other negotiations. Those are *known knowns*. There are those things we are certain that exist but we don’t know, like the possibility that the other side might get sick and leave us with another counterpart. Those are *known unknowns* and they are like poker wild cards; you know they’re out there but you don’t know who has them. But most important are those things we don’t know that we don’t know, pieces of information we’ve never imagined but that would be game changing if uncovered. Maybe our counterpart wants the deal to fail because he’s leaving for a competitor. **These unknown unknowns are Black Swans.**
* If an overreliance on known knowns can shackle a negotiator to assumptions that prevent him from seeing and hearing all that a situation presents, then perhaps an enhanced receptivity to the unknown unknowns can free that same negotiator to see and hear the things that can produce dramatic breakthroughs.
* I began to hypothesize that in every negotiation each side is in possession of at least three Black Swans, three pieces of information that, were they to be discovered by the other side, would change everything. My experience since has proven this to be true.
* Finding and acting on Black Swans mandates a shift in your mindset. It takes negotiation from being a one-dimensional move-countermove game of checkers to a three-dimensional game that’s more emotional, adaptive, intuitive . . . and truly effective.
* That’s why I say that finding and understanding Black Swans requires a change of mindset. You have to open up your established pathways and embrace more intuitive and nuanced ways of listening.
* No matter how much research our team has done prior to the interaction, we always ask ourselves, “Why are they communicating what they are communicating right now?”

### Three types of leverage
*In theory, leverage is the ability to inflict loss and withhold gain. Where does your counterpart want to gain and what do they fear losing? Discover these pieces of information, we are told, and you’ll build leverage over the other side’s perceptions, actions, and decisions. In practice, where our irrational perceptions are our reality, loss and gain are slippery notions, and it often doesn’t matter what leverage actually exists against you; what really matters is the leverage they think you have on them. That’s why I say there’s always leverage: as an essentially emotional concept, it can be manufactured whether it exists or not.*
1. Positive leverage
   Quite simply your ability as a negotiator to provide or withhold things that your counterpart wants. Whenever the other side says, "I want..." you have positive leverage. Positive leverage should improve your psychology during negotiation. You've gone from a sitation where you want soemthing from them to a situation where you both want something.
2. Negative leverage
   What most civilians picture when they hear leverage. It's a negoatiator's ability to make his coutnerpart suffer. It's based on threats: you have negative leverage if you can tell your counterpart, "If you don't fulfill your commitment, I will destroy you."

   This sort of leverage gets attention because it triggers loss aversion. If you shove negative leverage down your counterpart's throat, it maybe percieved as an attack on their automony. People will often sooner die than give up their autonomy, so they'll act irrationally and/or end the negotation. A more subtle technique is to label your negative leverage and make it clear/known without attacking. E.g. "It seems like your strongly value the fact that you've always been paid on time."
3. Normative leverage
   Each person has a moral framework. Normative leverage is using the other party's norms and standards to advance your position. If you can show inconsistencies between their believes and their actions, you have normative leverage. No one likes to look like a hypocrite.
### Know their religion
Access to this hidden space very often comes through understanding the other side’s worldview, their reason for being, their religion. Indeed, digging into your counterpart’s “religion” (sometimes involving God but not always) inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart.

Two tips for reading religion correctly: 
  * ​Review everything you hear. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with your team members. You will often discover new information that will help you advance the negotiation. 
  * ​Use backup listeners whose only job is to listen between the lines. They will hear things you miss.

* Research by social scientists has confirmed something effective negotiators have known for ages: namely, we trust people more when we view them as being similar or familiar.
* Every engineer, every executive, every child—all of us want to believe we are capable of the extraordinary. As children, our daydreams feature ourselves as primary players in great moments: an actor winning an Oscar, an athlete hitting the game-winning shot. As we grow older, however, our parents, teachers, and friends talk more of what we can’t and shouldn’t do than what is possible. We begin to lose faith. 
   
   But when someone displays a passion for what we’ve always wanted and conveys a purposeful plan of how to get there, we allow our perceptions of what’s possible to change. We’re all hungry for a map to joy, and when someone is courageous enough to draw it for us, we naturally follow.
* Research studies have shown that people respond favorably to requests made in a reasonable tone of voice and followed with a “because” reason.

### Why you counterpart is "crazy"
Whatever the specifics of the situation, these people are not acting irrationally. They are simply complying with needs and desires that you don’t yet understand, what the world looks like to them based on their own set of rules. Your job is to bring these Black Swans to light.

Voss, Chris. Never Split the Difference (p. 235). HarperBusiness. Kindle Edition. 
1. They are ill-informed
   People operating with incomplete information appear crazy to those who have different information. Your job when faced with someone like this in a negotiation is to discover what they do not know and supply that information.
2. They are constrained
   In any negotiation where your counterpart is acting wobbly, there exists a distinct possibility that they have things they can’t do but aren’t eager to reveal. Such constraints can make the sanest counterpart seem irrational. The other side might not be able to do something because of legal advice, or because of promises already made, or even to avoid setting a precedent.
3. They have other interests
   The presence of hidden interests isn’t as rare as you might think. Your counterpart will often reject offers for reasons that have nothing to do with their merits.

* During a typical business meeting, the first few minutes, before you actually get down to business, and the last few moments, as everyone is leaving, often tell you more about the other side than anything in between. That’s why reporters have a credo to never turn off their recorders: you always get the best stuff at the beginning and the end of an interview.

   Also pay close attention to your counterpart during interruptions, odd exchanges, or anything that interrupts the flow. When someone breaks ranks, people’s façades crack just a little. Simply noticing whose cracks and how others respond verbally and nonverbally can reveal a gold mine.

* Our sweaty palms are just an expression of physiological fear, a few trigger-happy neurons firing because of something more base: our innate human desire to get along with other members of the tribe. It’s not the guy across the table who scares us: it’s conflict itself. 
  
   If this book accomplishes only one thing, I hope it gets you over that fear of conflict and encourages you to navigate it with empathy. If you’re going to be great at anything—a great negotiator, a great manager, a great husband, a great wife—you’re going to have to do that. You’re going to have to ignore that little genie who’s telling you to give up, to just get along—as well as that other genie who’s telling you to lash out and yell.
* Remember, pushing hard for what you believe is not selfish. It is not bullying. It is not just helping you. Your amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear, will try to convince you to give up, to flee, because the other guy is right, or you’re being cruel. But if you are an honest, decent person looking for a reasonable outcome, you can ignore the amygdala.
* Whether it’s in the office or around the family dinner table, don’t avoid honest, clear conflict. It will get you the best car price, the higher salary, and the largest donation. It will also save your marriage, your friendship, and your family.

### Key Lessons
Here are some of the best techniques for flushing out the Black Swans—and exploiting them. Remember, your counterpart might not even know how important the information is, or even that they shouldn’t reveal it. So keep pushing, probing, and gathering information. 
  * ​Let what you know—your known knowns—guide you but not blind you. Every case is new, so remain flexible and adaptable. Remember the Griffin bank crisis: no hostage-taker had killed a hostage on deadline, until he did.
  * ​Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of leverage: positive (the ability to give someone what they want); negative (the ability to hurt someone); and normative (using your counterpart’s norms to bring them around). 
  * ​Work to understand the other side’s “religion.” Digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart. That’s where Black Swans live. 
  * ​Review everything you hear from your counterpart. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with team members. Use backup listeners whose job is to listen between the lines. They will hear things you miss. 
  * ​Exploit the similarity principle. People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with, so dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground. 
  * ​When someone seems irrational or crazy, they most likely aren’t. Faced with this situation, search for constraints, hidden desires, and bad information. 
  * ​Get face time with your counterpart. Ten minutes of face time often reveals more than days of research. Pay special attention to your counterpart’s verbal and nonverbal communication at unguarded moments—at the beginning and the end of the session or when someone says something out of line.
