## 1 Storytelling Essentials
* Stories cause the brain to release oxytocin, stimulate multiple sense and trigger mental models.

### Six Keys to Powerful Stories 
1. **Stories tap into emotion** The best stories trigger an emotional response, which is key to provoking empathy in the audience and unlocking decision-making. Research suggests that “emotionally charged events” carry far more weight and persistence in our memory than ordinary, neutral events.
2. **Stories put a face on an issue**: Nobody cares about processes or programs; they care about people. If you can embody your idea, your initiative, your brand in a great character that people can relate to, you’re going to have more success. 
3. **Stories connect us** Most people have never stepped foot in a candy factory, but they can still identify with Estela’s story. Why? Because it’s not about candy manufacturing; it’s about a mom looking out for the health and well-being of her children — something most of us can relate to. 
4. **Stories humanize us** The stories we tell offer a glimpse into who we are and what we value. And that’s highly appealing. It’s especially important for leaders — people want to follow humans, not machines. 
5. **They raise the stakes** The Estela story is not about manufacturing standards or error rates. It’s about health and safety and love and family. Stories raise us up out of the everyday and the mundane, appealing instead to universal values that bring us all together. 
6. **Stories are about “show, don’t tell”** As one of my instructors put it, “Actors express themselves through actions. That’s why they’re called actors, not talkers.” It’s better to show us who you are and what you stand for than to just tell us about it.

## 2 What is a Story?
* In its simplest form, a story is a **character** in pursuit of a **goal** in the face of some **challenge or obstacle**. 
* **How the character tries to resolve that challenge drives the narrative.**
* There are undoubtedly other elements to story — a turning point, climax, denouement, and more — but character, goal, and challenge are the three legs of the stool. Without these three, you don’t have a story.

### How to Bullet-proof your structure
1. Is the character real and relatable? The audience must be able to relate to the circumstances/values/qualities of the characters.
2. Is there sufficient conflict? Conflict arises from tension between the character's goal and the challenge facing them. No conflict == No Drama!
3. Are the stakes high enough? If the stakes are low, who cares?
4. Is there clear cause and effect? Causality creates meaning. A tightly linked chain of events creating continuity is a principle of storytelling.
5. Is there an emotional core? Stories should provoke an emotional response that the audience can harmonize with.

### About the Beginning, Middle, and End

* In the **beginning** you set the scene and introduce the **character**. This brings the observer into the world you are creating.
2. Next a **challenge** arises that upsets the balance and sets the story in motion.
3. The **middle** is where the character works to overcome the challenge and restore balance. (Most of the conflict should occur here.)
4. The **end** is where things come to a **resolution**. The normal state is restored or a new normal is established.

## 3 How to Create a Story
Creating a story involves these basic steps: 
1. Determine who you are trying to reach (your audience) and find out as much as you can about their wants and needs.
    * Who are they and what do they want? Explicit (material) and implicit (emotional) wants.
    * What do you have in common? Find a birdge between your goal and their needs and desires. What brings you together?
    * What are their doubts, feaurs, and misperceptions?
    * What do they know? Don't assume they have contextual knowledge.
    * What is their mood, mindset, and culture?
        * What are their sensitivities? 
        * Are there any hot buttons to avoid? 
        * Are there any big events going on in their lives that you should know about? 
        * What about the culture? Is it formal or laid back? Conservative or edgy? 
        * Maintain a constant state of awareness during the actual process of telling the story. Read the room. What’s the mood? Are people agitated? Impatient? Frustrated? 
        * Be prepared to adjust the tone and content of your story or even ditch it entirely if you sense a “bad vibe” or if there are too many unknowns. Always be calculating the potential risks and rewards.
2. Figure out what you want them to do — buy your product, work more efficiently, follow you into proverbial battle. That’s the goal. 
3. Think through the challenges that may get in the way of that goal — lack of budget, outdated technology, distrust. Often times answers come about in an organic, non-linear way. 
4. Find a character who has overcome that challenge — by appealing to value over price, working around technology, discovering common ground. 
    * The character is physically at the center of everything — the most important element. It’s what we really care about: people, not processes.
    * Your number one job as a storyteller is to find a character your audience can relate to. The most direct way to accomplish this is to choose a character that is as close as possible to your audience in situation and circumstance.
5. Make sure there’s a resolution to your story.
    * The most straightforward approach is where the character achieves the goal. 
    * Alternatively, the character may discover that the initial goal wasn’t that important after all, leading to personal growth or a new direction.
    * Sometimes the character is thwarted in pursuit of the goal but learns a valuable lesson.

## 4 Emotion Fuels Stories
### Emotion unlocks action
* We like to think we are rational beings, but deep down we know our decisions are largely emotion-driven. Facts and data are used to reinforce what we've already decided emotionally.
* If you want your audience to do something, make them *feel* something.

### Can you Go Too Far with Emotion?
* In most cases, it’s a good idea to dial it down. A modest display of excitement, disappointment, or righteous indignation is enough to stir an audience.
* Read your audience, occasionally it makes sense to go bigger.

### How to Capitalize on Emotion in Your Storytelling
**FOCUS ON THE “WHY”**
* What do you love about your work? 
* What makes you jump out of bed in the morning or go home satisfied at the end of the day? 
* How do you make people’s lives better, in ways large and small?

**Tap into Loyalty**
The bonds that connect people to each other and the community often run deep and can be a rich source of emotional connection.

**Appeal to Pride**
People want to feel part of something bigger. Shared history, heritage, values or a sense of community or brand loyalty carry emotional weight to ground stories.

**Celebrate your heroes**
Who do you admire and why? Draw lessons from their struggles and achievements.

**Get Personal**
What are your passions? What brings you joy or satisfaction? Are there lessons to draw on from these topics?

**Don't let Modesty stop you...**
* Ignore the voice that says "people don't want to hear this personal stuff"
* People do want to hear it - they crave a genuine connection with leaders.

**...or Fear**
* Don't fear emotional displays as weakness, but rather a judiciously use emotion for a strategic purpose.
* It's about the open expression of genuine feelings - including "negative" ones like anger and grief or "positive" ones like passion, enthusiasm, joy.
* It's not about you; it's about them. It's a duty of leadership to open up and reveal your humanity. It's also essential to delivering stories that have a real impact.

## 5 Stories At Work
This section has a bunch of case-study style short stories that help demonstrate the themes of the last 4 chapters.

## How to Focus your Story
* Just as important as what goes in to a story, is what you leave out.
* Which details will elevate the story and which will distract from it?
* Which elements should be amplified and which muted?
* What’s the best way to order the events?

1. Start with a Goal
    * Stories should support and reinforce the message that you're communicating. They should have a point.
    * Once you have a premise, every single word and action must support it and drive the narrative forward.
    * Every story we tell must have a goal, and every single detail must support that goal. If it doesn't, it should be cut - you are not trying to simply amuse, but change beliefs and behavior.
    * Eliminate anything that's not mission-critical and keep the narrative moving ever forward.
2. Eliminate the Bit Players
Minimize the footprint of any non-essential character (e.g. don't give them a proper name).
3. Avoid Tangets: How Storytelling is like a Tree
As much as possible, spend time moving from the base to the top of the tree, avoiding branches (and twigs!).
4. Stick to Clear Turning Points
Avoid minutae and details, provide the broad strokes that affect the narrative. Focus on the main change events.
5. Details, Details: Separating the Good from the Bad
Too many details — or too many of the wrong kind of details — can weigh a story down. So how do you distinguish between the details that bring a story to life and those that just clutter it up?

    **Use (brief) details to set the scene**
    Give a general sense of place and time, rather than specific details.

    **Offer sensory details to bring a story to life**
    Use descriptive terms that trigger a sensory response in the observer.

    **Simplify dates**
    Again, general timeframe, not specific dates unless it's a major event like September 11th.

    **Make numbers more meaningful**
    Generalize by rounding or using fraactions instead of percentages. Pick numerical expressions that are easy to mentally picture.

    **Omit Proper Nouns**
    * Don't give proper names to characters unless it's absolutely essential.
    * You don't need to be super precise with relationship to the main character (e.g. "cousin" instead of "third cousin once-removed")
    
6. Cut the Exposition
    * Jump right into the action, once you have their attention you can catch them back up.
    * Whatever you do, don’t begin with, “This is a story about …” Just start telling the story.
7. It's Okay to Lie (soft of)
    *  It's okay to simplify details for the sake of a better flowing story.
    * Omitting irrelevant details, compressing the timeline, or changing the order of events are all fair game. 
    * There’s a big difference between simplifying a story and altering its fundamental truth. A good test is to ask yourself whether someone who was there to witness the events would recognize your version as fair and truthful.
8. **Be Ruthless in Refining Your Stories**

## 7 How to Preserve the Integrity of your Stories
Your job is to defend your story from these outside forces and preserve its basic integrity. How do you do that? 

Through negotiation. Here are some tips: 
* **Prioritize what’s important.** Take a stand on the big issues like character, conflict, stakes, and emotion. 
* **Let go of the little things.** Be willing to compromise on the smaller things that may slow down your story but not stop it in its tracks — the odd department name or other non-essential information people insist upon. 
* **Have a conversation.** Seek explanation for the changes people want to make. Be open to the idea that their reasoning may actually have some validity. 
* **Cite evidence.** Support your choices by pointing to some of the evidence cited in this book on the power of story and emotion and their effect on the brain. 
* **Keep it positive.** Steer the conversation into positive territory. Instead of it being about what you can’t do, make it about what you can do.

## 8 How and Where to Find Great Stories
* Don't find stories using search engines! They're cliche at this point. Everyone has heard them and no one will react emotionally. They're also often wrong. 
* It's better to follow these steps:
  1. **Use Your Goals and Priorities as a Filter**
    Look for stories in every day life, TV, waiting in line, talking to friends. Goals, strategies, values, or brand that you are focused on will form your filter
  2. **Keep Your Antennae Up**
    Once you establish a filter, be alert for every day situations that make a good story
  3. **Read and Explore**
    Cross-train your brain. Read stuff outside your normal domains.
  4. **Interview Others**
      * Employees, friends, volunteers, constituents, etc. are a rich source of stories. Interview people you meet to find the great characters. 
      * Here are some interview questions:
          * What did you want to be when you were growing up? 
          * What does your child think you do? 
          * What’s the best lesson you learned from a parent, friend, or mentor? 
          * How did you get started? 
          * What do you love about your job? 
          * How does what you do make a difference to others? 
          * What frustrates you? 
          * What makes you proud? 
          * Who are your heroes and why?
  5. **Draw on Your Personal Experience**
      * It's only wrong to talk about yourself if the story is self-serving or self-indulgent.
      * Interview yourself (using the questions about)
      * Try writing and see what comes out!
  6. **Find a System for Storing Your Stories**
    Don't rely too heavily on memory - use a spreadsheet or notecards.
  
## 9 Story's Cousins: Comparison, Analogy, and Metaphor

**Choose Words that Stimulate the Senses**
* Words like “cool” evoke a sensory response and “our senses (e.g., sight, smell, and touch) have a big impact on linguistic success.”
* A “sharp” increase beats a “sudden” one, a “bright” future seems, well, “sunnier” than a “promising” one, and a “sour” disposition is more memorable than a “negative” one.
* Use visually evocative verbs. The words climb or soar are better than rise; grab or seize are superior to take; and hurl and toss beat throw.

**Use Metaphor and Analogy to Clarify**
Provocative metaphors, much like artful stories, are among the most impactful tools of influence ever, because they evoke feelings that bypass critical thinking. And they easily transform abstract ideas into tangible, simpler more relatable representations.

**Make Comparisons to Simplify Large Numbers**
Big numbers can be hard for most people to grasp, so it’s important to offer some scale by comparing them to everyday touchpoints. It's all about giving abstract numbers a human scale.

## 10 The Dark Side of Storytelling
**Do Stories Make Facts Irrelevant?**
Our brains lie to us, but overall stories not based on truth will only get you so far in the long run.

**A Rule for Storytellers: Do No Harm**
* We use the label “story” both for fact-checked articles appearing in an established newspaper and for tall tales told around the campfire. As stories take hold in the popular imagination, separating fact from fiction can be difficult.
* Does the truth matter? It depends if it does harm or creates suffering.

**The Tyranny of the Narrative**
* Reporters can only write the same story for so long. Today you’re a winner, tomorrow you’re a loser. Eventually the narrative’s pendulum swings back.
* For consumers of stories, beware the herd mentality. When the story sounds too good — or bad — to be true, check the underlying facts. 
* When the story’s about you or your company - when you’re riding high, enjoy it. But don’t get too comfortable — what the narrative giveth, the narrative taketh away. 
* When you can’t seem to catch a break, keep your head down and work your way through it. Your moment in the uncomfortable spotlight will eventually pass.

**Blurred Lines: The Brian Williams Effect**
* fact-check your stories. Run your account by others who were there. Write them down someplace so you’ll have a record. 
* Be especially mindful of how you portray your role in the events. It’s natural to want to make yourself more and more the center of a story, but that can be dangerous territory.

**Blurred Lines II: Experience vs. Memory**
* Memories can be blurred or created by retelling over time. 
* We interpret events based on our personal worldview, and it colors our interpretattion and retelling of events.

## 11 How to Tell Your Company's Origin Story
1. The normal story telling rules and elements apply
    * The audience is still mostly interested in themselves - what can you do for them?
    * Company values/strengths should serve as the narrative filter.
2. The Opposite of Story: The Corporate Timeline
    * Data points (in this case, time points) don't stick, stories do. You remember the Boston Tea Party, not when the Stamp Act was passed.
    * If you use dates as key points, make sure they are associated with a good story, be discriminating.
    * The point is to demonstrate the company's longevity or some other value, so use a story to celebrate it instead.
3. Examples - refer back to text.
## 12 How to Use Stories in a Presentation
1. Start With Story
    * Throw out the old formula - don't prime, tell, review. It's boring.
    * Craft a story about the problem that affects the observer(s) using the core story elements.
    * The story will prime them for the rest of your content better than previewing your agenda (assuming the story was relevant!).
2. Intersperse Stories Throughout (beware overload)
    * Audiences need variety, too much of anything - even stories - is detrimental
    * Stories need room to breathe and absorb
    * If your content is all stories, people will suspect you lack substance.
    * Convince with stories, reinforce with data and reality.
3. A loose guideline for incorporating stories
    * This is an art form and there is no hard and fast format for doing it.
    * Make assertion, offer evidence, supply data, tell a story, re-state the lesson - some combination of those elements in some order.
    * Maybe 1 story per major point in the speech/article.
    * Appropriate number of stories also commensurate with length of speech/article.
4. Open and Close with Stories
    * Audiences are most likely to hold onto the first and last things they hear and most likely to remember stories.
    * Best trick: make the closing story and extension of the opening story. The Endgame to your Infinity War. Ideally with some kind of twist or alternative viewpoint. Similar to a comedian doing a callback, triggering an 'aha' moment where the audience comes full circle.
5. Tips for Delivering Your Story
    * **Practice, practice, practice** 
      There's no substitute for preparation, and it also gives you a chance to trim the fat as you hear it over and over. Preparation reduces the risk of "runaway" storytelling - when your talk goes well and you get a high and start expanding the story.
    * **Stay Connected**
      Have intention and stay present and connected to the audience, even if you've heard the story N times. Continue to live the words like it's the first time. If you check out, so will they.
    * **Bring the Energy**
      * It's physical and emotional. If you aren't passionate, why should the audience be.
      * Everything should be larger than life - bigger, louder, more expressive and more movement.
    * **Vary Your Vocal Expression**
      Avoid monotone by: 
      * Emphasizing key words
      * Varying volume at key times to draw the audience in or excite them
      * Speed up as you approach the conclusion and pause for dramatic effect before the resolution/punchline.
    * **Use Your Body to Create a State Picture**
      * Use your face. Facial expression should match your emotional intent - you should *actually be feeling these emotions*. That's part of being connected.
      * Use your hands. Gesticulate to support what you are saying.
      * Mark the passage of time. If you are going from past to present or future stand at different parts of the stage to represent these phases. Go right to left when you move forward in time (the audience will see it as left-to-right, which is logical for most audiences).
      * Conjure your co-star. If your story involves re-creating a conversation, put the other person's shade in a clear spot on the stage.
    * **Bringing it All Together**
      * Good storytelling and presentations require good content and killer delivery. 
      * Good performance won't last without good content, and good contnet won't be heard without good delivery.
      * Just be you, do your best, and make sure you believe what you are saying.
## 13 How to Tell Your Own (Career) Story
  1. **What Not to Do: Alphabet Soup Syndrome**
    Don't read your CV allowed with a bunch of acronym-ridden job titles. Have a narrative or arc that distinguishes you.
  2. **Turn Your Life Into a Story**
    * Framing your career in a story makes it more entertaining and memorable.
    * Your narrative can justify or give context to your choices. It's not just a way of demonstrating what, but also why.
    * What sets you apart?
    * What drives you?
    * What do you stand for (values)?
    * What value do you offer?
    * How are you making a difference?
    * Insurance salespeople make for good storytellers because they can always relay some tale of disaster where they helped someone recover their life.
  3. **Discover the Implicit Narrative of Your Career**
    * Something is always driving us forward, whether it's values, a character trait, a skill, or a person. Even when you feel disconnected there is often a pattern that becomes clear later.
    * *You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever..."* -Steve Jobs
  4. **Start by Examining Your Career Highlights**
    * Start with war stories - promotions, awards, rejections, failures.
    * Do anything themes/patterns emerge?
    * What skills did you bring to bear on the problems you faced? 
    * What traits helped you succeed? 
    * What did others have to say about your role?
    * What did you most enjoy about that work? 
    * How did it make you feel?
    * What is the driving force that has driven and satisfied you, been central to your success, at every stage of life?
  5. **Structure Your Story**
    1. The beginning: the “normal state” of things. 
    2. Inciting incident: something that disrupts the normal state. 
    3. Turning point: the path you took in response. 
    4. Conflict: challenges along the way. 
    5. The end or resolution: which brings it all full circle.
  6. **Remember Your Audience**
    * Your personal story still needs to be tuned to the audiences' needs and interests.
    * You may develop different versions of the story to tell to different audience groups.
  6. **Keep Working at It**
    * May be hard at first, must be persistent
    * Mine personal experience if needed
    * Get outside feedback
## 14 How to Tell Your Personal Brand Story
  1. Why Brand Yourself?
    * Can be a practical tool for distinguishing yourself or gaining credibility.
    * Allows you to promote yourself in a way that feels natural and not overly promotional.
    * Brand values can help guide you through a crisis.
  2. What is a Personal Brand?
    * What you are known for. The Unique combination of qualities you bring to the table that make other people want to X with you.
    * Your brand will happen, it's whether or not you want to manage it. 
    * *"You're building your brand daily, either by design or by default"* -Bonnie Gillespie
  3. We Can Only Control so Much
    * Ultimately, your brand is what others say it is, so some of it is beyond your control.
    * You can affect people perceptions by carefully communicating and acting on your brand. It's all about taking charge of your story.
  4. How to Figure Out Your Brand
    * What specific traits and skills were instrumental to overcoming past challenges?
    * Think about the times people bring you onto a team at work. What are they generally looking for from you? What role do you end up playing? 
    * Look at your past performance reviews. What themes emerge? 
    * What about awards, honors, and accolades? Are there any patterns there?
    * The information from these sources should be consistent with how you are presenting yourself.
  5. Examples of Personal Brands
    * The Analyzer — the one who thinks through every angle of a problem? 
    * The Organizer — who puts all the pieces together and harnesses the right resources? 
    * The Innovator — the person who comes up with the bright idea? 
    * The Cool Cucumber — the proverbial calm at the center of the storm? 
    * The Bulldog — the tenacious fighter who breaks through all the obstacles?
  6. How to Present Your brand to the World
    * If you have the luxury of choosing your assignments at work, your brand should influence which projects you take on. After all, your brand represents your strengths. If you’re an analytical person and do your best work locked away in a windowless room breaking down a problem, you’re probably not the ideal choice to send on a customer-schmoozing mission. 
    * Outside of work you have more control over your agenda, so your brand might drive the kinds of activities you get involved with in your community. This is not about being selfish; it’s about playing to your strengths and helping out in the best way you can. If you want to help with the school fundraiser and you’re lousy with money, don’t sign up to be treasurer! 
    * Your brand will also affect how and what you communicate, from the way you describe yourself in writing to how you introduce yourself, to what you choose to contribute in meetings. All of that should be “on-brand.”
  7. The Role of Your Brand Story
    Here are some of the occasions that might call for a brand story: 
    * In job interviews, when you’re asked about your greatest strengths. 
    * On sales calls, when prospects want to know why they should choose you over your competitors. 
    * When you’re introducing yourself to a new group of people and you want to communicate who you are.

    Your brand story should be structured like any other story — character (you), goal, challenge, resolution. For the source of your stories, mine your experience. Think about: 
    * Major work/career accomplishments 
    * Awards you’ve won 
    * How you solved a problem 
    * Why you do what you do 
    * Why you joined the organization you’re now working for 
    * Why you started your business
  8. How to Talk About Yourself Without Sounding Like a Jerk
    * It starts with positioning, remember good stories start with someone ordinary transforming to meet a challenge. If you start off as all-knowing, there is nowhere to grow to. 
    * Authenticity produces credibility. They'll believe you if they believe in you.
    * Attribute stories to others.
    * Don't undersell yourself either. The goal is a clear understanding of strengths and weaknesses and the ability to clearly communicate both without apology.
## 15 How to Use Story for a Toast, Tribute, Eulogy
  * No rules, each one will be highly personal. 
  ### Guidelines for Writing a Eulogy or Toast:
  * Speak from the heart.
  * Avoid the laundry list. Narrow down to 3 qualities if possible.
  * Pick one quality to focus on and make it the theme.
  * Compose a story that exemplifies that quality. Sometimes a funny story works well here.
  * Attend to the small details, like sensory details, that give a story more impact.
  * Cut the excess details
  * Draw a lesson. Relate the story to a moral or lesson learned.
  * Use a quote that captures the point you are making to introduce or conclude.
  * Mind the clock, no one likes a long speech.

  ### How to deliver a Eulogy or Toast
  * Practice
  * Notes are okay
  * Expect the unexpected - you may get emotional at parts you didn't expect
  * Don't over-apologize (or at all, really) if you get emotional
  * Pause and breathe to regain your composure.
  * Humor works, just don't be inappropriate or overdo it.
  * Be careful with eye contact - might cause some people to break down.
  * Forgive yourself for anything that doesn't go perfectly.
