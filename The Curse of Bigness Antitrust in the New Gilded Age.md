# The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age
**Tim Wu**
*April 2019*

## Introduction
- We are four decades into an experiment in unrestrained capitalism, wherein the major nations have weakened their laws meant to control the power of corporate and industrial giants.
- This experiment has resulted in a new Gilded Age, including the same extreme economic concentrations, and the same risk of extremist leadership taking hold. The road to fascism and dictatorship is paved with failures of economic policy to serve the needs of the general public.
- We must realize that we face what Brandeis called the "Curse of Bigness", which represents a profound threat to Democracy. It is manifested in the fact that the middle and working classes have no influence on policy.
- Is concentration compatible with Democracy and liberal society? Is it possible to create a diverse, broadly-distributed economy in a system controlled by monopolists?
- This book is about exploring antitrust laws and how they might be updated. In the 1950s, antitrust law was broadly considered to be a vital part of the a functional economy (based off the market failures of the 1920s and 30s, and the success of the FDR-era recovery).
- In the last generation (since Nixon, basically) antitrust law has been obliterated, and society no longer views it as relevant or essential.
- America, once again, must choose an economic policy - monopoly or competition?
  - Antitrust law was seen as an ackownledgement of the choice the American electorate had made repeatedly over decades. It's diminishment must also be seen as an acknowledgement of the electorate's diminished enthusiasm.
  - Antitrust laws are suffering from the ideas first made popular by Robert Bork and the Chicaco School of Economics in the 1970s. They contended that Congress (in the 1890s) intended for antitrust law to only consider higher prices for consumers. These ideas have not made good on their promises of greater certainty and scientific rigor.
  - Chicago School policies have mostly resulted in government abandoning its' role in preserving economic liberty by checking the accumulation of wealth and power by private interests.
- We are seeing clear parallels between America in the 1910s and 2010s in terms of both wealth and power inequality, as well as economic concentration, which substantially reduces the competitiveness (and arguably, the resillience) of the market. 
- Antitrust is not a panacea for inequality, but it does directly address one of the most significant risks and challenges - economic concentration which facilitates political power.
## 1 The Monopolization Movement
- In the 1890s the Trust movement was reorganizing the American economy (sort of like a tree root system) to make the habitat more amenable for massive companies like Standard Oil and AT&T. Germany had similar titans like I.G. Farben, Japan had the zaibatsu system run by the Imperial government. The goal was to create a monopoly for every sector, unrestrained by government or competition - Economic Autocracy.
- From 1895 to 1904 the number of manufacturers in the US dropped from 2,274 to 157 through mergers and acquisitions.
- Monopolists saw themselves as progressives and fashioned their success as a form of **social darwinism**.
- The monopolization movement was a philosophical break. American tradition had resisted *any* centralized power. (because the English Crown had owned some of the all-time "great" monopolies like the East India Company)
- The Boston Tea Party was an anti-monopoly protest. Americans were mobile, optimistic, speculative, anti-authoritarian, egalitarian, and competitive.
- Most proufoundly, it changed the relative sense of equality among citizens - before the Gilded Age there was very little aristocracy (at least in the North and West - less so in the South, both ante- and postbellum)
- “Among the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of condition among the people.” -Alexis De Tocqueville
- "No problem is more threatening than the inequality of condition, wealth, and opportunity...if the concerted powers of this combination are entrusted to a single man, it is a kingly perogative, inconsistent with our form of government." -Senator John Sherman (of [Sherman Act]() fame)

## 2 The Right to Live, and Not Merely to Exist
- [Louis Brandeis]() - Son of entreprenuerial Czech/Polish immigrants, which shaped his views about what an economy should like in a Democracy
- "Lying and sneaking are always bad, no matter what the end...I don't care about punishing crime, but I am implacable in maintaining standards."
- He came to believe in "human scale" businesses. Found that trusts sold false goods ("not the progress that was promised") — often big trusts exterminated competitors, mistreated workers, defrauded investors, and hid gross inefficiencies in the service of bank and shareholder profits (as a cross-reference, many trustbusting efforts, including breaking up Standard Oil resulted in far more successful child companies. You might know some of them - Exxon, Mobil, and Chevron, combined market cap - 535 Billion US Dollars).
- “We are in a position, after the experience of the last twenty years, to state two things: In the first place, that a corporation may well be too large to be the most efficient instrument of production and of distribution, and, in the second place, whether it has exceeded the point of greatest economic efficiency or not, it may be too large to be tolerated among the people who desire to be free.”
  1. Corporations may become to large to be truly efficient
  2. Even if a large corporation is efficient, it is not desirable to let any private entity grow powerful enough to steer the government.
- He believed the "ideal" of democracy was "the development of the individual for his own and the common good."
- “The true end of man, or that which is prescribed by the eternal or immutable dictates of reason … is the highest and most harmonious development of his powers to a complete and consistent whole.” -Wilhelm Von Humboldt
- “The ‘right to life’ guaranteed by our Constitution” should be understood as “the right to live, and not merely to exist. In order to live men must have the opportunity of developing their faculties; and they must live under conditions in which their faculties may develop naturally and healthily.”. 
  - Therefore, a good country and economy would provide sufficient liberty an adequate support to live meaningful, fulfilling lives.
- Freedom includes freedom from industrial or corporate domination and exploitation and insecurity such that one can't live without fear of unemployment and poverty. **"~~Men~~ People are not free if dependent industrially on the arbitrary will of another."
- Economic security is a foundation upon which a person can be free to develop to their full capacity. This underscores the importance of steady, but not oppressive work, education, leisure, public services, and outdoor spaces. It's about giving people the mental and physical space to be fully human — **to thrive**.
- Success is about people building a craft, practicing as best they can, and living and working in a morally good way that serves the community. 
- There is no business exception for ethics. Government is responsible for providing a check on industrial and corporate malfeasence.
- Concentrated power in any form is dangerous, institutions should be built to human scale, and society should pursue human ends. No institution is immune from taking on a life and mind of its' own, and what benefits businesses don't always (or generally) benefit the average human.
## 3 The Trustbuster
- [Theodore Roosevelt]() - became President after the assassination of William McKinley.
- Two weeks before assuming office he gave a speech (as Vice President) proclaiming it was time for the State to assert its autority over the trusts, "The vast individual and corporate fortunes, the vast combinations of capital which have marked the development of our industrial system, create new conditions, and necessitate a change from the old attitude of the State and the nation toward property."
- Believed that ignoring economic misery would result in the rise of more extreme ideologies (Communism, or 20 years later, Fascism). Immense power (represented by concentrated wealth) can only be met with the supreme power of the people. The question of his time was whether the government had the power to control the trusts.
- The term "trust-buster" came into vogue, but they were also called "octopus hunters", which is way more awesome. Trusts and robberbarons were viewed like octopi, with their "tentacles" in everything.
- Appellation (noun): a name or title. E.g. San Diego's appellation is "America's Finest City".
- “A man of great wealth (*likely referring to JP Morgan*) who does not use that wealth decently is, in a peculiar sense, a menace to the community.” He added that the **“trusts are the creatures of the State, and the State not only has the right to control them, but it is in duty bound to control them wherever need of such control is shown.”**
- The Sherman Act, like the Constitution, is so broadly worded and unclear in its application that it does not take real meaning or shape without an enforcement tradition.
### Political Antitrust
- Roosevelt's goal was both economic and political. He saw enforcement of the act as essential to making it clear that as a democracy, elected officials ultimately had the final say.
- "Power that controls the economy should be in the hands of elected representatives of the people, not in the hands of an industrial oligarchy." - Justice William Douglas. **Anti-trust enforcement is a pro-Constitution action.**
- The concentration of economic power threatens other American values, like the independence of small business and local control over industry. Losing this focus on local contribution and control have had a big role in creating the conditions that have lead to climate change, environmental degredation, and economic inequality.
- Excessive concentration of economic power breeds antidemocratic political pressures (E.g. the Koch brothers). The role of enforcement should be driven by a concern (or better yet, paranoia) that too much concentrated economic power will translate into too much political power and threaten the Constitutional structure.

   Ed. — one problem is that the media portrays our modern robberbarons as sympathetic figures when the government tries to reign them in. The SEC case against Mark Cuban wasn't that strong, but the media will run every clip of Cuban whining about how he's being harrassed, when they KNOW the government can't comment on their case publicly. We need to find a solution around that.
- In general, small and organized groups will outcompete large, disorganized groups in both business and politics. Unrestrained corporations have the ability to focus a large amount of resources on pushing the need in very specific directions in a way the disorganized public can't compete with.
- The more concentrated an industry gets, the less coordination is required and the greater the share of the rewards. It's easier to coordinate and satisfy the needs of 6-8 stakeholders, instead of 60-80. Concentrated industries also make it easier to crush the power of labor. The more concentrate an industry, the more corruption we can expect in the political process (i.e. not serving the public interest). It's inevitable that once a business no longer has to worry about basic survival - they begin building moats and castles. 
### The Abusive Trust
- For Roosevelt, it was an absolute necessity to break up Standard Oil, as the largest and oldest of the trust. The Sheman Act could not have legitimacy while Standard Oil remained.
- Among the objections to the Trust movement, as we’ve seen with Brandeis, was the observation that the drive to bigness and monopoly also seemed inevitably to come with its own morality, one that either displaced or replaced Christian or other moral strictures, at least for matters of business.
  - Ed. — Corporations (at least in the form they've largely existed in through history) are authoritarian and fascist in structure. It shouldn't be surprising that such an organization replaces a religious morality with the morality of the Corporation (or State, if we're thinking about European fascism). Fascist morality  dictates that if it makes the state stronger or more successful, then it is morally good.
- This chapter details the Standard Oil case, and is worth reading if you are interested in a good overview that moves along pretty well.
  - Interestingly, just before the case proceeded, Roosevelt offered to nationalize Standard Oil and buy it. It's worth a short thought-experiment of how our country might have developed if we had a nationalized oil industry in 1906. It hasn't worked well in most countries, but they are mostly corrupt Latin American and Middle Eastern counties (and Mexico...oops). It has worked for Norway and Saudi Arabia (depending on your definition of "worked") The US and Roosevelt's administration in particular could have had more success, and it would have had knock-on effects for how Capitalism and Communism were viewed in the country. AT&T would later be the first to accept a version of that offer.
  - Ultimately the nation picked competition and democracy over monopoly and autocracy. The linguistic relationship here is important - competition is from the latin for rival and democracy translates to "the people rule". In both cases, it is clear that separate groups of people are participating non-violently (rival does not mean enemy) in a fashion that gives them roughly equitable power and influence. Alternative, autocracy and monopoly both have root words meaning one - "rule by one" and "single seller".
- Justice Harlan concurred in the dissolution, but was incensed that the Court hedged and concluded that more reasonable conduct would have been permissible. The quote is below, but he essentially says that these regulations were an echo of the mood of the country in 1890s. Slavery was still in living memory, and the people felt a real sense of danger that the concentration of wealth in a few corporations and individuals would result in a return to a form of slavery (or serfdom, which was practiced Russia until the Communist Revolution a decade later). **The Sherman Act was passed as a statutory bulwark to protect the people against oppression and corporate wrong-doing.**     

   "All who recall the condition of the country in 1890 will remember that there was everywhere, among the people generally, a deep feeling of unrest. The nation had been rid of human slavery, fortunately, as all now feel—but the conviction was universal that the country was in real danger from another kind of slavery sought to be fastened on the American people; namely, the slavery that would result from aggregations of capital in the hands of a few individuals and corporations controlling, for their own profit and advantage exclusively, the entire business of the country, including the production and sale of the necessaries of life. Such a danger was thought to be then imminent, and all felt that it must be met firmly and by such statutory regulations as would adequately protect the people against oppression and wrong."

### Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
- At some point size becomes a detriment to efficiency, rather than a boon. The value of growth is subject to caveats (in ways that we are only JUST beginning to fully appreciate).
- Large businesses maybe produce goods *as a lower cost*, but lower cost may also mean worse products, poor labor conditions, and uncovered environmental externalities.
- As businesses grow every larger, they may even become less efficient, more cumbersome, less dynamic. General Motors was the paragon of efficiency in the 1950s, and was filing for bankruptcy by the 1980s because they got outcompeted by the Japanese.

   ![](@attachment/the_curse_of_bigness_diseconomies_of_scale.png)

- Large businesses begin to enjoy a different kind of advantage, not operational efficiencies, but the ability to wield economic and political power. These businesses may not become more efficient or effective, except at building a better moat.
- Larger and more powerful firms have a clear bargaining advantage over its works, monopolists most of all (where ya gonna go?). They can work people harder for less money, hire thugs to break collective action, suppress wage growth, push ridiculous non-compete agreements, and vary employee hours to keep them part-time. The more concentrated the power of the industry, the easier it is to screw people.

### Antitrust's Constitutional Moment
- Roosevelt had great admiration for the power and scale of the trusts (Roosevelt had a huge hardon for any form of power), but believed that the government was more powerful and must demonstrate its primacy and soverignty over the economy. He would later advocate an early form of fascism, which he called [New Nationalism](), which would have essentially nationalized or enthralled the remaining trusts to the government (most of the big ones had been broken up by 1912 by Roosevelt or Taft).
- To summarize, in the 1910s the United States made a choice, where they picked decentralization over concentration, and competition over monopoly. That choice has not been repealed democratically.

## 4 Peak Antitrust and the Chicago School
- The political support for antitrust in the postwar era was as a philosophical bulwark against what had happened in counties that had adopted centralized ideologies like those of the Axis Powers (and Communism in the USSR/China). Fascism's rise was facilitated by tolerance of monopolies - the monopolists fueled Hilter's rise to power, and he only needed to cow a handful of men in order to gain total control of the economy. Here is the [Rick and Morty version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duJKvDndclQ&t=53) of how this might have looked.

- "I think we must decide very quickly what sort of country we want to live in. The present trend of great corporations to increase their economic power is the antithesis of meritorious competitive development … Through monopolistic mergers the people are losing power to direct their own economic welfare. When they lose the power to direct their economic welfare they also lose the means to direct their political future."

   "I am not an alarmist, but the history of what has taken place in other nations where mergers and concentrations have placed economic control in the hands of a very few people is too clear to pass over easily. A point is eventually reached, and we are rapidly reaching that point in this country, where the public steps in to take over when concentration and monopoly gain too much power. The taking over by the public through its government always follows one or two methods and has one or two political results. It either results in a Fascist state or the nationalization of industries and thereafter a Socialist or Communist state." - Senator Estes Kefauver, author of the Anti-Merger Act
### The Rise of the Chicago School
- Through the 50s and 60s both Liberals and Conservatives supported anti-trust. Liberals wanted to counter the domination of big business (i.e. they were afraid of fascism) and Conservatives feared "a road to serfdom" resulting from centralized planning achieved through monopolies (i.e. they were afraid of Communism).
- The Chicago school was started by Aaron Director, a former socialist-leftist, who swung right by the 1950s. Basically attacked the Supreme Court's antitrust case law as insensitive toward "consumer welfare", which he narrowly defined as low prices.
- They engaged in a successful, logically fallacious strategy of attacking antitrust laws on what they should be instead of what they are, and effectively changed the law by changing the view of the judiciary, rather than by capturing the legislature (they would eventually capture the legislature in the 90s). Remember that when Republican's start talking about activist judges - it's projection, just like it always is.
- Robert Bork (of "Borking" fame) became the intellectual engine behind this strategy. He was a New Deal liberal until Director turned him. Both appear to have been ideological extremists in one direction or another.
- Bork undermined the notion that antitrust represented a deliberate choice of economic structure and a check on private power. He basically argued that the Sherman Act was actually passed for the exact ideological reasons he already held - what a coincidence. Just like the "Originalists" on the court, somehow Robert Bork was uniquely able to divine a meaning of the law that is substantially in conflict with what the authors of the law are recorded to have said about it's passage.
- Bork's narrow reading of the Sherman Act threw out the broader concerns about coentration of power that had driven enforcement, and the idea that antitrust represented a democratic choice of economic structure.
- Bork attached his theories to the idea that the laws were too vague, and left the judiciary with simplistic tests to apply, rather than having to do the hard work of understanding the issues of each case. 
- Ultimately his legacy is a simplistic view of economics that allowed laissez-faire capitalism to re-establish itself in America - the belief that the market should be sovereign from the government.
## 5 The Last of the Big Cases
- The second AT\&T breakup was the last major antitrust breakup in the United States. Started by Nixon, and later settled by Reagan. The result was a break up into the baby bells. Much like a T-1000, these entities would eventually re-coalesce into AT\&T (by way of Cingular), Verizon, and Sprint. 
- AT&T was a regulated monopoly in the truest, "Morgan-ian" sense of the word. They ruthlessly destroyed any competition or even paying lip-service to competition. The change in policy came as a result of them aggressively trying to run MCI out of business and their increasing resistance to government regulation in the 70s. The government sensed that AT\&T was trying to escape it's enclosure, to use Jurassic Park parlance.
- Most importantly, the breakup revealed how much monopoly had been holding back innovation. After the break up we got answering machines and modems. No breakup, no home internet in the 90s.
- The last *attempt* at antitrust enforcement came in the 90s under Clinton when the DOJ brought enforcement action against Microsoft. The government prevailed, but appeals were still pending when the Bush administration took over, and they settled the case without a breakup.
## 6 Chicago Triumphant
- Courts readily abandoned traditional foundations of antitrust law in favor of Bork's theories as part of a backlash against perceived "judicial activism".
- Chicago introduced the ideas, but they were mainstreamed when they reached Harvard.
- "The persistent dominance of an industry by a single firm is not to be expected," and long term, sustained dominance "should be regarded as an actionable manifestation of market failure." - Nobel laureate economist Oliver Williamson
- Chicago argued that modern monopolies are benevolent and are naturally responsible, because if they weren't then *surely* some competitor would arise to replace them *wink*. 
  - They usurped Congressional intent, arguing through the courts that laws Congress had passed explicitly to [block mergers](merger act 1950) and [protect small businesses](robinson-patman act 1936) didn't make economic sense, and therefore should be ignored. That is an abuse of the sytem, aided by conservative and reactionary jurists.
  - Much like everything with the modern Republican party, they shout "activist judges!" because everything is projection, and that's what they are doing.
  - Modern right-wing jurists like Antonin Scalia have gone full kool-aid, arguing that monopoly is a necessary incentive to motivate businesses to take risks.

### In Defense of the Big Case Tradition
- The IBM antitrust action in the 1970s created the cracks for Microsoft to form in. The antitrust case against Microsoft created the cracks for Google, Facebook, Intuit, LinkedIn and other companies to form in. What great innovations in tech and other industries are being choked out by the lack of regulation on today's conglomerates?
- Historically trustbusting has merely tempered corporate power for a time, but has failed on its' promise of restructuring dominant firms to orient them toward serving the common interest. 
  - An alternative approach could be writing *pro-competition* laws for persistently uncompetitive industries (rather than *anti-trust*), such as an escalating series of hurdles and actions as a company or industry grows more concentrated. **Just like good video games, operating a business should grow harder (on some curve) as your entity gains more resources and power.**
  - The United Kingdom has a Market Investigation Authority with the ability to break up monopolies that have been proved to be substantial persistant for at least 10 years.
  - Philosophically, this goes back to the Brandeisian ideal that the evils of monopoly were independent of how monopoly was achieved or who achieved it. It's a systemic threat.

### The Age of Oligopoly
- Since Bush 43 we have re-entered an era of concentration that rivals the original Trust era. We have national monopolies, regional monopolies, or oligopolies in the following industries throughout most of the country:
  - Telecommunications & Cable (AT\&T, Verizon, Comcast, Spectrum, Cox, Charter)
  - Major Airlines (American, United, Delta and their respective "alliances")
  - Pharamceuticals
  - Ticketmaster
  - Agribusiness (Bayer)
  - Beer (InBev and Coors)
  - Entertainment (Disney)
  - [Consumer Packaged Goods](http://www.convergencealimentaire.info/map.jpg)
- This consolidation continued under Obama, who appointed officials who were expected to be enforcement-oriented, but were faced with a judiciary now-stacked with hostile, Chicago-school jurists. This is why the Republicans go hard when it comes to court appointments - it's the strategy that has worked for them for 50 years.
## 7 The Rise of the Tech Trusts
- The tech industry has consolidated since the 90s behind the companies who survived the initial bubble burst (and a few others like Facebook and Netflix who formed after)
- Facebook is able to kneecap competition by acquiring upstart competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp, removing existential threats for a steal.
- All the technology giants have made 65+ acquisitions (more at this point) as a means of maintaining their moat.
- When the giants can't acquire a company, they set out to destory it by cloning it, like Facebook did with Snapchat and Vine. Sometimes it works in reverse - Amazon acquired Zappos and Diapers.com after failing to clone them out of existance - but the consolidative effect is the same.
## Conclusion: A Neo-Brandeisian Agenda
So now that we know the problem, what do we suggest for solutions?
1. **Merger Review**
- Current practice has deviated from Congress' original intent in passing the Merger Act. The law sought to erect a barrier to economic concentration and gave the government the authority to stop mergers to preserve competitive markets. Consolidation is a dynamic force (it gains momentum), merger reviews are a braking force on that momentum.
- Review should not focus solely on economic analysis (which creates perverse goals), but create broader and tougher merger standards, with the largest companies receiving the most scrutiny.
- We could also consider structural presumptions, like per se bans on mergers that would reduce competition below a specified number of firms.

2. **Democratization of the Merger Process**
- One challenge is that antitrust falls somewhere between a traditional executive agency and a judicial process. It should be treated as a matter of administrative law, where no party has any right to secrecy. Procedings should be made public and include a public comment period, similar to how FCC rulemaking is conducted (fuck Ajit Pai). 
- Big mergers are political in nature - the corporations trying to merge know that. The public should acknowledge it and treat it as a political process.
- If the agency doing merger reviews plans on a consent agreement, that agreement should also be subject to public comment.

3. **Big Cases**
- Revive the tradition of enforcement by hiring the best legal minds and pursuing big cases. That's what Congress intended and the law hasn't changed, only the way the courts are interpretting it. That's not how the system is supposed to work, and Congress and the Executive need to work together to unfuck the Article III branch in this regard.

4. **Breakups**
- Pursue breakups of conglomerates. Avoid consent decrees, which rely on the goverment being skilled at compliance, rather than investigation and enforcement. The government is great at investigation and enforcement, but terrible at compliance.
- Facebook might not like being dissolved, but it's hard to see what cost would be borne by society or what efficiencies would be lost. If anything, the knock-on effects would be positive. 
- Introducing pro-competition laws, measured by things like privacy protection, would have great value to the public. 
- A stable democracy is not compatible with a single conglomerate like Facebook having so much influence over free speech. The simplest way to reduce the threat is to reduce Facebook.
- Breakups are self-executing, and thus the cleanest remedy to prescribe.

5. **Market Investigations and Competition Rules**
- The US should empower the FTC to investigate market dominance after 10 persistant years.
- The FTC & FCC should use their rule making authority more broadly to lower barriers to market entry and promote healthy competition.

6. **Antitrust's Goals**
- We must abandon the absurd notion that the Sherman Act was meant to "protect consumer welfare" and return to first principles. 
  - Concentration of power is dangerous, private power especially so, because they have no accountability to the public. When private entities continue to grow ever-larger they begin to gain competitive advantages through moat building and capturing the State, rather than through efficiency. 
  - America has a freedom loving and entrepreneurial spirit, which runs counter to the idea of corporate domination.
  - Americans rejected Trusts 100 years ago because they saw that the Trust model would lead back to slavery (or serfdom), which for them was still a recent memory.
  - The government has an obligation to assert its primacy over the American economy. Corporations are a creation of the State (and thus not philopshically entitled to the same rights as natural people, cross-ref Citizen United, et al.), and the State has the absolute right to dictate the terms of their continued existance. 
- Courts should assess whether corporate conduct promotes, suppresses, or destroys competition, not "consumer welfare". Courts are better at protecting a process than doing math and optimization problems (which is what happens in consumer welfare cases, since they are all about price models).
- The Magna Carta, the Constitution, and other foundational laws of democracies were created with the idea that power should be limited, distributed, decentralized, checked, and balanced, such that no person or entity could have unaccountable influence. This vision did not contemplate that the government might allow private power that would rival the public's - business people with mroe influence than Senators, or corporations with the rights of actual humans.
