## 1 Building a successful relationship
### I get to be me, you get to be you.

In adult relationships, *differentiation* means that each person:  
* is separate and different from the other  
* has their own needs and emotions 
* has their own preferences and dreams 
* has their own character and truth has their own “yes” and their own “no” 
* is autonomous and takes responsibility for choices and actions 
* is not responsible for the needs and emotions of the other.

### Your Shadow
*Disowned parts not accpeted by your parents. We often grow to resent (loathe) these parts.*

Disowned parts include: 
* emotions, such as anger, sadness, excitement, passion or joy  
* characteristics or traits, such as competitiveness, shyness, expressiveness, playfulness, vulnerability, beauty, boldness, introversion, or extroversion   
* needs that were not acknowledged and supported, such as acceptance, nurturing, support, intimacy, autonomy, empathy, or self-worth
* masculine traits for women (e.g. assertiveness) or feminine traits for men (e.g. empathy)

If, as a kid, you felt unsupported in: having strong emotions, being vulnerable (seeking comfort), being powerful/autonomous, making mistakes/taking risks, following dreams and exploring talents, then those things might be a part of your shadow.

When parts of us are disowned, other adaptive parts develop to keep disowned parts hidden. For example, if vulnerability is disowned, an inner perfectionist might develop, whose role is to keep vulnerability hidden by never making mistakes. These adaptations help us cope in childhood, but modern life holds no formal mechanism, no rite of passage, to help cleanse us of these maladaptive models.


### The Link to Love 

![icon](@attachment/differentiation_and_linking.png)

Linking in human relationships means that two people: 
* Care about each other 
* Express their care through words or actions and through repairing the relationship when connection is broken or compromised  
* Matter to each other 
* Offer and ask for support, including emotional support 
* Co-create 
* Share openly and meaningfully, including expressing emotions and vulnerability, and listening with empathy and presence 

*Attunement* is particularly important for linking. Attunement refers to being aware of another’s emotional state and needs through noticing and reading verbal and nonverbal signals.

*Resonant Responsiveness* is responding to another person's needs and emotions with an energy that harmonizes with that person's emotional state (e.g. responding to sadness with tenderness). The most effective way to increase your capacity to attune and resonate with another person, be that with a child or an adult, is to reclaim disowned parts and increase your window of tolerance for all emotions.

## 2 Attached to Love

### Highlights
* Linking has stalled when you stop really listening to your partner, stop learning new things about your partner, stop expressing care through actions and words, stop reaching out for help, do not consider or empathize with your partner’s feelings and needs, stop trying new things together, and stop opening your hearts to new depths. Whereas differentiation increases attraction, linking deepens love.
* Often, adults who do not receive the support to heal their attachment trauma will focus only on security, and consequently cease to differentiate, grow and explore.

### Review
**Attachment Trauma**
* Trauma The neglect or abuse or repeated impairments in differentiation and linking between parent and child 
* Passed along from generation to generation until resolved 
* Influences what we believe about ourselves, others, and the world

**Attachment Styles** 
* Children have different attachment relationships with different parents and caregivers  
* The attachment style of the relationship is determined by the attachment style of the parent or caregiver 
* Adults can have different attachment styles with different people but will have a default style for intimate relationships 
* Children have different attachment relationships with different parents and caregivers  
* The attachment style of the relationship is determined by the attachment style of the parent or caregiver 
* Adults can have different attachment styles with different people but will have a default style for intimate relationships 

**Secure or Earned Secure Attachment**: Adept at differentiation and linking.

**Ambivalent Attachment**: Wanting more linking but not trusting it Becoming easily flooded with emotions. Results from inconsistent/unpredictable linking between parent and child. Child will never know if parent will "be there for them" emotionally, and will be outwardly anxious during stress.

**Avoidant Attachment**: Being less comfortable with linking Being cut off from many emotions. Results from parents not expressing empathy or linking with child. Child will learn to not show emotion as a coping mechamism, but will feel the same anxiety as the ambivalent during stress.

**Disorganized Attachment**: Greater challenges with linking and differentiation; bigger outbursts and upsets; greater challenges with addictions and mental health. Results from more dysfunctional sitations.

**Empathy**: Listening for the feelings and needs of others, no matter how they are expressing themselves, and reflecting those back when helpful to do so. 

**Neuroplasticity**: Some neural networks (such as those involved in relationships) can be re-wired and further developed throughout life.

## 3 Your relationship memory

### Highlights
*The way we talk to our children becomes their inner voice. ~ Peggy O’Mara*


### Review
**Explicit Memory**
Consciously recalling something from the past, either an episode or a fact

**Implicit Memory**
* Stored and recalled without our awareness, effort, or intention 
* Includes perceptions, emotions, actions, sensations, and mental models

**The Autonomic Nervous System** 
* The sympathetic nervous system: fight/flight, accelerate 
* The parasympathetic nervous system: rest/digest, slowing down 

**Epigenetics** 
The expression of our genes is influenced by our environment, including the kind of nurturing we receive 

**Amygdala** 
* Functions from birth
* Generates emotions 
* Always asking: “Am I safe?  Am I accepted?  Do I matter?” 
* On the lookout for danger and loss of connection, including experiences that look similar to past traumatic events 
* Sounds the alarm to activate the fight/flight and freeze 
* Does not know that time passes and things change 

**The Hippocampus** 
* Begins functioning at approximately eighteen months 
* Is responsible for explicit memory 
* Integrates experiences and information 
* Neural networks not fully integrated with the rest of the brain 
    * This system doesn't communicate directly with the amygdala, which is why the amygdala can hijack things, even when higher reasoning should prevail 
* Under stress can trigger unconscious reactions

## This is your Brain on Emotions
**Brain Stem** 
* Sometimes known as the reptilian brain 
* Runs automatic functions of the body 
* Involved in fight/flight or freeze activation 

**Limbic Regions** 
* Sometimes known collectively as the mammalian brain 
* Home of the amygdala and the hippocampus
* Involved in generating emotions and seeking attachment 

**Middle Prefrontal Cortex**
* Evolutionarily the most advanced part of the brain 
* High-order cognitive processes 
* Regulation of emotions 
* Fear modulation (calming the amygdala)
* Empathy, attunement 
* Insight, mindsight 
* Morality, intuition 

**Flipping Your Lid** 
Losing connection between your middle prefrontal cortex and your amygdala. 

**Emotional Regulation** 
Feeling your emotions without getting overwhelmed by them, and allowing them to guide you to your needs. 

**Left hemisphere of the Brain**
Leads the way in much of your day-to-day living as you store and recall practical and intellectual information, socialize, manage your time, make sense of things, solve problems, and execute tasks.

**Right Hemisphere of the Brain**
Leads the way when you are deepening and enriching relationships by empathizing, resonating, regulating emotions, and tuning into your inner experience and that of others. 

**Window of Tolerance**
The amount of intensity the amygdala can tolerate before sounding the alarm bell. Once you leave your window of tolerance you move into fight/flight or freeze and lose your connection to your middle prefrontal cortex. 

**Repairs** 
Restoring connection with empathy.

## Communicating for Love

**Nonviolent Communication (NVC)** 
Also known as Compassionate Communication, NVC is a process (sometimes linear, sometimes non-linear) composed of 3 parts and 4 components. 

*The 3 Parts* 
1. **Self-Connection/Self-Empathy.** Observing your thoughts, feeling the sensations and emotions in your body, and connecting to the needs that your thoughts, sensations, and emotions are pointing to. 
2. **Empathy for Another (Supportive Empathy and Empathy During a Dialogue).** Setting aside advice, sympathy, your own stories, judgments, and other responses and instead listening for others’ feelings and needs, no matter how they express themselves. 
3. **Honest Expression.** Speaking your truth without judgment or blame using observations, feelings, needs and requests. 

*The 4 Components*
1. **Observations.** Factual information that comes in through the senses—what we hear, see, smell, taste, and touch—free of any judgments or interpretations that the mind might add. 
2. **Feelings/Emotions.** An emotion is energy in your body that you feel with your nervous system. Emotions are separate from thoughts—judgments, evaluations, interpretations, and so on. 
3. **Needs.** The energy of life. Needs are abstract, universal, intrinsic qualities of energy and wholeness that, when felt or experienced, enrich life. Needs are not attached to outcomes, to specific people, material objects, actions, places, or times.   
4. **Requests/Strategies.** Specific, doable, positive actions people can take to meet needs. 

**Resonance** 
Resonance is the part of communication that speaks to the right hemisphere through metaphors as well as through tone of voice, body language, touch, and eye contact. 

**Getting into Trouble with NVC** 
* Making it a dogma. 
* Making it a fix-it tool for the left hemisphere and losing the intention of connection. 
* Forgetting about doing the inner work of NVC and forgetting to explore strategies for connection other than dialogue. 

**Needs-Based Worldview** 
Everything we do is an attempt to meet a need. All actions and behaviours, whether seen as positive or negative, are attempts to meet needs or are expressions of needs. If we continue to place attention on needs, we can find strategies and solutions that work for everyone. 

**Needs-Based Boundaries** 
Knowing your needs matter equally along with everyone else’s needs and taking action to make sure your needs are met, sometimes through a dialogue with another person, sometimes by acting independently.

## 6 The Love Affair of a Lifetime
### Highlights
* Falling in love is one of the most beautiful parts of being human. Nonetheless, a long-term intimate relationship is not a happily-ever-after affair; it is an adventure and a quest that takes us not just to dazzling peaks, but also into dark valleys. However, relationship challenges are not a sign of failure. They are a natural result of deepening intimacy and commitment and offer opportunities to continue healing and growing. The hidden treasure in a relationship is not found in being made “whole” by another, but in uncovering and healing wounds and attachment trauma so you can share more and more of your inspiration, passion, kindness, and love with each other.
* When inner healing work is done deeply and consistently enough, it leads you to the beauty in your shadow, and you become smitten with the treasures found therein. But beware: the courtship of your shadow is not to be taken lightly. It requires a romance like no other, one in which you are called to turn toward fears and dark places, face the unknown, fall apart, crack open, and feel it all. It is the love affair of a lifetime in which there is always more to discover, pursue, and captivate. The more you learn to love your shadow, the more you discover that darkness is not a place of annihilation or despair; rather, it is a wellspring of creativity, energy, growth, and inspiration.
