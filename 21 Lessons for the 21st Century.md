# 21 Lessons for the 21st Century
**Yuval Noah Harari**
*March 2019*

Notice: I own or legally borrowed this book and took these notes to memorialize and further my learning. If you enjoyed these notes, **[please purchase the book here](https://amzn.to/2LsxtkB)** or borrow it from your local library.



**The Technological Challenge**
## 1 Disillusionment
*The end of history has been postponed*

- Humans think in stories, not numbers or equations. The simpler the story the better
- The liberal (western/enlightenment) story celebrates liberty and holds u\it up as the solution to core problems
- In 2019 people have no story to describe the global order - Fascism, Communism and Liberalism have all fallen with nothing to replace them
- Democracy has struggled to keep up with technological change. Society doesn't understand the tech or how to integrate it with society
- In 1938 people in the USSR/USA/Germany had bleak conditions, but they were told they were part of a great struggle that would lead to a brighter future (see the propaganda). Most people don't relate to a future promised by AI and Genetic Engineering
- The liberal story has survived challenges - it has been more dynamic and flexible than other ideologies by abopting best practices (e.g. valuing empathy alongside liberty)
- Liberty is not worth much without the social safety net (i.e. are you really "free" without it?)
- Democracy is based on Lincoln's principle - you can fool all the people some of the time, and some people all of the time. You can't fool all the people all the time. Eventually the national mass will notice and revolt
- Liberalism has no clear answer for ecological collapse and technilogical distruption (AR: These processes must be managed and strict liberalism [often libertarianism in the US] is counter to statist policies that would enable management)

## 2 Work
*When you grow up, you might not have a job*

- Machines and algorithms will continue to improve at both "job-stealing: tasks and their ability to "hack" the human mind by learning to read biological signals and body language (which is mostly subconsious)
- This can be a boon for humanity - e.g. AI doctors can provide world-class care anywhere in the world with all of the knowledge in the world
- This can be a disaster for humanity - Billions of unemploed worldwide; incredible disparity between haves and have nots
- Care and creativity will be the hardest features for machines to replace (although not impossible)
- Personalized art and music could be both wonderful and manipulative - it's tailored for you, but brands can also use specific songs to manipulate your (YOUR) emotions
- Some areas will see job growth to support AI, but these will be high-education jobs like analysis, security, and administration
- Retraining people every decade may be neccessary, but seems impossible
- Volatility of labor cycle will make labor rights impossible since industries could be created and moved to full automation in a 10 year cycle
- We need to develop new social and economic models to cope with these changes as a first-order problem. The goal should be to protect people, not jobs
- We need to better define "universal" and "basic" with regard to the social safety net
- Social support must be supplemented with meaningful pursuits for those without meaningful work (AR: tbh, this is already a major issue today that isn't talked about)

## 3 Liberty
*Big data is watching you*
- Traditionally both Democrats and REpublicans agreed on the basic liberal stories and values - free markets, elections, independent judiciary, expand human rights
- **Elections/referenda are ALWAYS about human feelings**
- "Free will" is really a series of chemical signals, which most humans share. In theory, algorithms could be trained to read these cues very accurately, then act on that information to manupulate or extort
- Biotech and infotech are both going through revolutions. The results may be computers who know our bodies better than we do. 24/7 health monitoring, ultra-targeted treatments; but could also be used to discriminate, regulate or influence behavior in un/desirable ways
- Algorithms gain authority as we learn to trust the wisdom of its' justdements (e.g. google maps, waze after seeing it accurately guide you multiple times). Reliance on this authority is dangerous, because it makes you helpless when you are without
- Algorithms can (do) create a black box that is an effective cover for discrimination in finance, health, etc.
- We have to invest in human conciousness on the same level as AI, or else the technology will exacerbate human stupidity (e.g. Idiocracy)

## 4 Equality
*Those who own the data own the future*
- Property necessary for both welath accumulation and inequality to happen
- AI could enable a tangible capability gap between the rich and poor (e.g. Gattaca or Elysium)
- If we want to prevent extreme wealth/power concentration the key is to regulate teh data
- People give away data like native americans gave up their land - they only consider what they are getting, not what they are giving up
- Who does biological PII belong to? Humanity has no experience with these types of data-centric philsophical questions

**The Political Challenge**
## 5 Community
*Humans have bodies**
- Communities are the social backbone of humanity, but have0 declined recently
- Will Facebook successfully use AI for social engineering or are we better served by priests and politicians?
- Technology is distancing humans from their bodies, senses, selves, making them disoriented and unhappy
- How can tech giants extoll virtues of community while using global leverage to destroy communities (e.g. by dodging taxes, depriving localities of revenue)

## Civilization
*There is just one civilization in the world*
- Many people subscribe to "clash of civilization" theory, which posits that different cultures are actually separate, incompatible civilizations
- False notion - humans can organize themselves N different ways based on K beliefs, but there are inherent differences between groups of humans. Culture changes and evolves over time
- Religious texts and histories can be selectively read and interpretted to justify decisions and cultural shifts. **Culture is what we make it**
- Human unification has come in 2 parts so far - linking distinct groups and homogenizing practices
- War increases homogenization by spreading tech and ideology
- Compared to history, political paradigms are pretty consistent — there are no more empires (in the classical sense), very few city-states (and no leagues, trade unions, etc). Most political paradigms are a nationalist soverign with some kind of central administration, usually even a parliment (token or otherwise).
- The US Dollar is the ultimate example - trust in the Federal Reserve is such that democracies, autocracies, drug lords and terrorists all trade in USD.
- Doctors and scientists in Tel Aviv, Riyadh and Pyongyang all believe e=mc^2, germs cause infections, and medical processes and the scientific method look similar in most of the world (AR: except China). These are examples of homogenization.
- Western world, Far East, Islamic world have stark differences in culture and identity, but all are part of human civilization. **We are more similar to each other than to our ancestors** (AR: even ones from 3-4 generations ago)
- Biggest 21st century challenges will be global and require a civilizational effort

## 7 Nationalism
*Global problems need global answers.*
- Nations are not inherent in human nature — they are a recent invention that allowed "big" problems to be solved by combining resources
- Good nationalism (i.e. Patriotism) — "My country is unique". Bad nationalism — "My nation is supreme"
- Nukes changed the calculus for nationalist wars
- Global humanity is facing a multi-front ecological war — Phosphate/Nitrogen based farming methods, destroying ecosystems, and carbon-induced climate change
- Since there is no truly national answer to climate change (an inherently global problem), Nationalist politicians prefer to pretend the problem doesn't exist
- Some nationalist solutions could include national investment in science, engineering and civil preparation projects (e.g. Total war, but to save the planet) 
- Technology is another supranational problem that the nation-state is not designed to handle. There is no national solution to transnational social networks.
- Technology could change the nature of humanity itself - what does a nation matter in the face of a new species?
- Declining powers or terror-states may face a use-it-or-lose-it choice if new tech allows the invalidation of their nukes
- We don't need to dissolve national identity to succeed, but everyone needs to subscribe to the human story

## 8 Religion
*God now serves the nation.*
- 3 types of problems:
  - Technical - how to deal with climate-related drought
  - Policy - how should goverments deal with climate change
  - Identity - why should I care about other tribes?
- We no longer associate religion with farming or medicine, but it used to be
- Religion is not very good for technical or policy issues. Science and economics do not differentiate along religious lines
- Human cooperation is necessary to solve big problems. Cooperation depend on mass identities/shared stories - not science or economies.
- Rites/Ritual/Religion allow groups to build bonds with shared stories
- Religion serves the state - it evolves to justify the actions the state was already pursuing

## 9 Immigration
*Some cultures might be better than others.*
- Immigration can be seen in 3 terms
  1. The host country allows immigrants in
  2. In return, the immigrants must embrace at least the core norms and values of the host, even giving up their own traditions
  3. If the immigrants assimilate enough, "they" become "us"
- Pro-immigration: You can't stop immigration anyways; it's morally right to allow it; immigration is a right; low bar to entry, diversity improves culture; co-adaptation acceptable or even desirable
- Anti-immigration: Nations have a right to soverignty; it creates additional burden on the taxpayers; immigration is a privilege; high bar to entry; unrestrained immigration degrades the current culture; immigrants should assimilate
- There are mismatched expectations as traditionalists see 1-2 generations as short, but for 2nd/3rd generation individuals, they've never known another country - if they don't belong here then where?
- Are both sides fulfilling the bargain?
  - When the answer is no, the pro- group blames the host for not being accommodating enough
  - When the answer is no, the anti- group blames the immigrants for a failure of effort or character
- Traditional racism is waning, more discrimination is based on cultural norms (culturism)
- Culture has more malleability, allows for tokenism and acceptance upon full assimilation
- Discrimination against immigrants can manifest due to differences in communication, conflict resolution, etc.

**Despair & Hope**
## 10 Terrorism
*Don't panic.*
- A terrorist is like a fly in a china shop - the only way for the fly to destroy the shop is if someone freaks out and starts swatting indiscriminately
- Terrorism is an unfavorable strategy that is only used by organizations that are massively outresourced. These organizations are too weak to wage an actual war
- Terrorism is theater - they think like Hollywood, not the Pentagon. We judge it by emotional, not strategic impact
- Nothing terrorists do can actually defeat us - only we can through our reaction to the acts. For the terrorists, it's basically a free roll - the downside of failure is a few expendable operatives
- States overreact because political violence undermines the leigitmacy of the State - if they can't keep the country secure, they will lose the mandate
- When political violence was common (e.g. 1150's Jerusalem) people would have ridiculed modern terrorists - they're hardly a real threat compared to a Crusade!

## 11 War
*Never underestimate human stupidity.*
- Pax Americana - war causes 1% of deaths worldwide, down from 5% in the 20th century and 15% before that
- Most post-WW2 conquest has been economic or cultural
- Only successful invation in the 21st Century are Russian invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, but even those had a high cost - Russia got bogged down in the Ukraine and stalled and economic sanctions have taken a toll
- US took advantage of USSR/Russia after a feaceful dissolution - US treated USSR as defeated, expanded NATO, and invaded the Middle East - Russia's reaction is logical
- Successful war is harder because looting isn't as profitable - the money is in knowledge and data, which can't be easily pillaged. Nukes make trying a suicide pact. Big powers are also more susceptible to counterattack at home in a global world
- Just because wars can't succeed doesn't preclude them - humans are stupid

## 12 Humility
*You are not the center of the world.*
- Everyone is self-centered, thinks their culuture invented everything, and is the center of the universe
- "Since it is more polite to criticize one's own people than foreigners, I will use Judaism to llustrate how ludicrous such [Jewish-centric] self-important narratives are, and I will leave it to the read to puncture their own tribe's hot air balloon"
  - Jews put their religion an equal footing with Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hindu, but Judaism's role is much more modest. It's a tribal religion, not a universalist one
  - Begat Christiantiy and Islam, but doesn't get credit for the achievements of those religions (or the blame for the atrocities)
  - Akin to Freud's mother — she begat Freud, but otherwise wasn't super noteworthy
  - Old testament (which is part of Christianity) is far more prevalent than the Talmud (which is distinct to Judaism)
  - Judaism has ~15M adherents world wide. Christianity, Islam and Hindu are all over 1B, with Buddhism over 500M
  - Confucious, Lao Tzu, Buddha and Mahavira established ethics codes way before Jesus and Paul, and completely apart from Jewish culture
  - Confucious came 500 years before Rabbi Hillel with the same basic message - Love others as you love yourself
  - Monotheism creates religious bigotry because it's universalist. In polytheist culture its normal for other people to have different gods
  - Jews didn't contribute to the corpus of human knowledge (other than Spinoza) until secularization in the 1700s allowed them to apply their prodigious, culturally imbued study skills to science and reason
  - Conversely, anti-semites give Jews way too much credit about their level of influence.

## 13 God
*Don't take the name of God in Vain.*
- Don't take the lords name in vain could read as - don't use God to justify your bullshit
- Morality is about reducing suffering, not orthodoxy
- **Hurting others hurts yourself. Violent acts start as violent thoughts distrubing your peace of mind.** You don't steal unless greed/envy are burning you up (AR: unless you steal food because you are hungry, that's just normal human shit).
- Turn the other cheek really means - don't carry that shit around
- Religions do provide a moral system, but aren't the only path to morality

## 14 Secularism
*Acknowledge your shadow.*
- The religious view it as an absence of God/morals/etc, but adherents view it as the prescence of a positivie, active world view and coherent, defined morals and values
- Morality and wisdom are natural legacy of human history and experiences - this explains why consistent themes appear in disperate religions/cultures
- Commitment to truth based on observation and evidence, not belief
- Don't sanctify any group or story as if it has a monopoly on truth
- Have compassion and a deep appreciation for suffering
- E.g. Gay marriage doesn't promote beastiality because gay marriage promotes human well-being, both emotional and spiritual. Marrying a goat wouldn't do that. Secularism wouldn't ask such a bizarre question, only someone who sees marrying as a miraculous ritual 
- Cherish scientific truth as a means to reduce suffering
- Cherish responsibility — no higher power to pass blame onto, only your fellow human to turn to for help
- Secular education isn't about instilling a lack of belief (mere a perk), it's about learning to discern truth from belief, develop compassion for all suffering, appreciate wisdom and experience of humanity, to think freely without fear and to take responsibility for their options for the world as a whole
- Secularism is a commitment to truth, compassion and freedom, not a lack of belief. Ergo Stalin was no a secularist - Stalin was dogmatic
- Secular movement are not afraid of their shadows. Able to easily move on from "old ways" when better ideas come along. Also more pragmatic - less focus on eternity, more on here and now.

**Truth**
## Ignorance
*You know less than you think.*
- Liberal thought has developed immense trust in the rational individual, which might be a myth, since humans make decisions based on emotion
- Individuality too, is a myth - we think and form opinions as groups. We owe our species' <vocab class="words-of-power">ascension</vocab> to our ability to think in large groups to do complex organized labor.
- People fail to realize their ignorance and propose policies on tropics they don't have the foundation to understand
- Most news shaped by communal groupthink and held because of loyalty. Bombarding someone with facts and explosing their ignorance will backfire. People don't like having too many facts and don't like feeling stupid. Data won't convince them. See Non-Violent Communication and Never Split the Difference to see alternative methods
- It's hard to discover truth from teh top. President/CEO roles are too busy being broad to go deep or spend time experimenting. Wasting time (i.e. boredom and experimentation) is the path to truth
- **Power is all about changing reality rather than seeing it for what it is**
- Great power is like a black hole that warps space around it; the closer you get, the more twisted everything becomes. If you want truth, you must escape the gravity well of orthodoxy and allow yourself to wander. Existing knowledge is at the center, the revolution is at the edge (AR: Wheels make a fun analogy here - all the force is pulling and pushing on the center, but the motion is/revolutions are occuring at the wheel edge)

## 16 Justice
*Our sense of justice might be out of date.*
- Justice demands both values and a concrete understanding of cause-and-effect (e.g. Am I personally responsible for events in the West Bank, or the actions of companies my 401K invest in?)
- Greatest crimes in modern history were allowed to happen through indifference
- Modern world is too complex for our sense of justice, so people use 4 methods to manage it:
  1. Downsizing - *It's not as bad as you think.*
  2. Appeal to emotion - *If it feels good, it must be right.*
  3. Conspiracy - *But you don't know for sure, do you?*
  4. Dogma - *It's right because we've always done it that way.*


## 17 Post-Truth
*Some fake news lasts forever.*
- Fake news is as old as civilization — governments and religions have used propoganda since society was a thing
- Some fake news lasts forever in the form of discriminatory stereotypes
- You cannot organize masses without getting buy-in on some kind of mythology
- **The most powerful, scholarly establishments like priests and ideologues favor unity over truth**
- Underneath the fake news is real suffering
- Instead of denying the complexity of the situation, try harder to distinguish truth from fiction
- It's an individual responsibility to examine our bias and verify sources (AR: I'd argue it's both individual and group responsibility - in a Democracy you have a moral obligation to inform yourself and then to inform others)
- Sci-fi is more valuable politically than scientific journals like Nature or Cell. (AR: Because they put complex ideas in familiar and easy to digest frames)

## 18 Science Fiction
*The future is not what you see in movies.*
- Sci-fi is the most relevant artisitic medium for understanding changing technology and biotechnology developments, but Marx is still a better guide to society than Spielberg or Cameron.
- It can demonstrate technology can be used to manipulate people, as advertising already does, or in the more classical 1984 fashion

**Resilience**
## 19 Education
*Change is the only constant.*
- **Change is coming.** What do you teach a kid that will serve them in 2050 or 2100? How do you begin to guess what will be useful? In 1018, you could reasonably predict what daily life would be like in 1050 or 1100. No longer true.
- Today the problem is too much info and misinfo. In the old days it was a lack of access
- People need the ability to make sense of the info, separate signal from noise, and combine information into a broad worldview
- Experts say we should be teaching the 4 C's:
  1. Critical Thinking - *Wait, but why?*
  2. Communication - *How am I supposed to do that?*
  3. Collaboration - *How do we both get our needs met?*
  4. Creativity - *There is no such thing as a no-win scenario.*
- Todays' kids may have to reinvent every dedcade, instead of once or twice. How do we prepare them for that?
- To survive in the new world you will need mental flexibility and reserves of emotional balance
- Biotech and Machine Learning can lead to automated, manipulation by reading/pulling human biochemistry triggers. In order to combat that we need to understand our own "operating system" much better. (AR: For a good *science fiction* example of this, please read the Foundation Series)

## 20 Meaning
*Life is not a story.*
- Humans are storytelling creatures
- **In the Bhagavad-Gita when Arjuna doubts himself, Krishna tells him that within each being is Dharma, or purpose, that they must fulfill. If you fulfill your Dharma you will have peace of mind even if the path is difficult. Deviate and you will feel no joy. There is no right or wrong path so long as you are mentally committed.**
  - This is the lesson of the Lion King. Mufasa is Krishna, Simba is Arjuna. Hakuna Matata is the antithesis of Dharma, and Simba fulfills his Dharma after explicitly rejecting Hakuna Matata.
- Believing a set of stories imbues even mundane tasks with comsmic/holy meaning (e.g. washing the feet of the poor)
- Nationalist/supremacist ideologies preclude peace because victory has cosmic meaning
- All stories are incomplete. To give meaning to life it must:
  1. give me a role to play - no one likes a story they can't see themselves in;
  2. a story that expands beyond my timeline, embedding larger meaning - i.e. part of the larger whole
- "I am here on Earth to help people. I still haven't figured out why everyone else is here." -W.H. Auden
  - **The chain of kindness fulfills both conditions.**
- People believe cultural/religious/tribal fictions because their personal story is built around that, as are collective institutions
- Rituals are how humans turn stories into reality, belief.
  - Hocus Pocus comes from Latin - 'Hoc est corpus!' or 'This is the body (of Christ)
- Anything can be a ritual — gestures (e.g. bowing), clothing, food, crowns, etc.
- Confucian China was all about observing rites. Bad outcomes would be blamed on a lack of orthodoxy/observance
- Objects represent gods - the cross is Christ, the flag is the country - thus objects are ritualized
- The orthodox will punish or invoncenience the secular as a way of ostracizing them within the in-group, but this primarily hurts the weak and inflicts unnecessary suffering 
- People are a portfolio of identities, and they can compartmentalize opposing ideologies
- Fascism is an ideology that insists adherents only follow the nationalist story. Not all nationalists are fascists. In fascism all things are evaluated based on how it serves the nation (AR: where in the nation maybe narrowly defined)
- The problem with depicting fascism as monstrous is that no one looks in the mirror and sees a monster, so they'll never see a fascist staring back
- Hollywood exaggerates villans - Vader, Voldemort, Sauron. Christianity knew better - Satan was depicted as handsome, charming and human
- People will swap back to other stories if the fascist story is broken
- <strong>The meaning of life isn't a readymade product or divine script. It is I who <vocab class='words-of-power'>imbue</vocab> everything with meaning through my choices and feelings</strong>
- Humans wrote the stories and our minds give them meaning
- *Everything changes, nothing endures, nothing is completely satisfying. -The Buddha*

## 21 Meditation
*Just observe.*
- The practice is to observe body sensation and mental reactions in a methodical, continuous, and objective manner to uncover basic mental patterns
- We must improve our understanding of mentality/consciousness so we can keep up with technological progress
