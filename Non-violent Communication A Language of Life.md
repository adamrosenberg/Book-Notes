# Non-violent Communication: A Language of Life
**Marshall B. Rosenberg**
*May 2019*

## 1 Giving From the Heart
**What I want in my life is compassion,
a flow between myself and others based
on a mutual giving from the heart.** 
— Marshall B. Rosenberg, PhD

### Introduction
**NVC: A way of communicating that leads us to give fromt he heart.**

### A Way to Focus Attention
- NVC combines language and communication skills that strengthen our ability to remain human, even under stress
- NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and hear others.
- Instead of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious responses based firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting.
- NVC teaches us how to express ourselves with honesty and clarity, while simultaneously paying others a respectful and empathetic attention. 
- It allows us to hear our own deeper needs and those of others and perceive relationships from a different point of view.
- The process is also a reminder to keep our attention focused on a place where we are more likely to get what we are seeking.
### The NVC Process
1. Observations - the concrete actions we *observe* that affect our well-being
2. Feelings - how we *feel* in relation to what we observe
3. Needs -  the *needs*, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings
4. Requests - the concrete actions we *request* 
in order to enrich our lives.

NVC requires that you both express honestly and receive empathetically through the four components

### Applying NVC in Our Lives and the World
- "I learned to listen for feelings, to express my needs, to accept answers that I didn’t always want to hear. He is not here to make me happy, nor am I here to create happiness for him. We have both learned to grow, to accept, and to love, so that we can each be fulfilled."

### NVC in Action: "Murdered, Assassin, Child-killer!"
- In this example Marshall recounts his communication with angry, Palestinean refugees.
- "Our dialogue continued, with him expressing his pain for nearly twenty more minutes, and me listening for the feeling and need behind each statement. I didn’t agree or disagree. I received his words, not as attacks, but as gifts from a fellow human willing to share his soul and deep vulnerabilities with me."

## 2 Communication That blocks Compassion
Do not judge, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged… —Holy Bible, Matthew 7:1

**Certain ways of communicating alientate us from our natural state of compassion.**
### Moralistic Judgments
- Using moralistic judgments that imply *wrongness* or *badness* because another person didn't act in concern with *our* values is an alientating form of communication.
- In the world of judgements, our concern centers on "who is what".
- When we speak in judgment of others, we are thinking and communicating in terms what what is wrong. Our attention focuses on classifying, analyzing, and evaluating degress of wrongness, rather than focusing on what each person needs and is not getting.
- Analyses of others are actually expression of our own needs and values.
- It is important to distinguish value and moralistic judgments. We all make value judgments about what is important in life (e.g. honesty, freedom, peace, etc) that reflect our beliefs about how life can best be served. We make moralistic judgments about people who fail to support our value judgements. 
  - The statement — "Violence is bad. People who kill others are evil." — is a statement on the wrongness of violence, and judges those who commit violence as morally evil. 
  - When we articulate our feelings and ideas based on needs and values, we might say something like "I detest the use of violence to resolve conflicts; I value conflict resolution through peaceful means." 
- Classifying and judging people promotes violence.
### Making Comaprisons
- Comparisons are a form of judgment.
- As we engage in comparison we tend to focus on the negatives within ourselves, rather than the positives.
- The deeper the comparisons go (e.g. On the Sinek model - the closer you get to the why, the inner circle) the most comparisons will undermine your sanity and sense of self-worth.
### Denial of Responsibility
- Communication becomes life-alientating when it clouds our awareness that we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings, and actions.
- Our language obscures awareness of person responsibility.
- Refers to Eichmann in Jerusalem (Arendt) - the Nazis denied personal responsibility as "just following orders". 
- We engage in denial of responsibility when we attribute our actions to forces outside ourself. E.g.
  - Vauge, impersonal forces - *I did it because I had to.*
  - Self-labeling & the stories we tell ourselves - *I drink because I'm an alcoholic*
  - Other peoples' actions - *You made me do that*
  - Authority (ref: Milgram, Zimbardo) - *I was following orders*
  - Group pressure (ref: Asche) - *I smoke because my friends do* 
  - Appeal to the law/policy/regulation - *We have to suspend you because we have a zero-tolerance policy.*
  - Gendered, social, or age roles - *I have to grind away to provide for my family*
  - Uncontrollable impulses - *I was overcome by my urge to eat.*
- We can replace language that implies a lack of choice (which everyone hates) with language that acknowledges choice (which everyone likes)
- We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel. 

<blockquote>I have thought for a long time now that if, some day, the increasing efficiency for the technique of destruction finally causes our species to disappear from the earth, it will not be cruelty that will be responsible for our extinction and still less, of course, the indignation that cruelty awakens and the reprisals and vengeance that it brings upon itself … but the docility, the lack of responsibility of the modern man, his base subservient acceptance of every common decree. The horrors that we have seen, the still greater horrors we shall presently see, are not signs that rebels, insubordinate, untamable men are increasing in number throughout the world, but rather that there is a constant increase in the number of obedient, docile men. —George Bernanos</blockquote>

### Other Forms of life-alientating Communication
- Communicating desires as demands blocks compassion. A demand either explicitly or implicitly threatens the recipient with retribution.
- **We can't make other people do anything.**
- The concept that some actions merit reward or punishment can also lead to alientating communication. It ends up expressed as what someone "deserves" (e.g. he deserves to be punished), which is a judgment. 
- Most of us grew up speaking a language that encourages us to label, compare, demand, and pronounce judgments rather than be aware of what we are feeling and needing..
- We learn early on to dissociate from our needs and feelings, being undesirable, for one stupid reason or another (e.g. religion, masculinity).
- Life-alienating communication stems from and supports hierarchical or dominant societies. The language of wrongness, should, and have to are used to create a servitude or slave mentality where we focus on the morality of our actions instead of their value. 
- **When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we are free people.**
## 3 Observing Without Evaluating
OBSERVE!! There are few things as important, as religious, as that. —Frederick Buechner, minister
- The first component of NVC requires the separation of observation from evaluation. When we combine the two, we decrease our ability to hear the intended message or that others will hear ours. We/they will hear criticism.
- It does not require objectivity, just the separation of observation and evaluation.
### The Highest Form of Human Intelligence
### Distinguishing Observations from Evaluations
- | Observations and evaluation tend to get mixed most frequently  under the following communication patterns

| Communication  | Mixed Signals | Clear Signals |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Using the verb "to be" without indicating that the evaluator is responsible for the evaluation | You are too loud. | When you yell and sing, I think you are being too loud. |
| Use of verbs with evaluative connotations | Doug procrastinates. | Doug only studies for exams the night before. |
| Implication that one's inferences about another person's thoughts, feelings, intentions, or desires are the only ones possible | She won't get her work in. | I don't think she'll get her work in. |
| Confusion of prediction with certainty  | If you don't eat balanced meals, your health will be impaired. | If you don't eat balanced meals, I fear your health may be impaired. |
| Failure to be specific about referents | Children don't take care of their stuff. | I haven't seen the children from down the street clean up their sports equipment.|
| Use of words denoting ability without indicating that an evaluation is being made. | Hank Smith is a poor soccer player.  | Hank Smith has not scored in 20 games. |
| Use of adverbs and adjectives in ways that do not indicate an evaluation has been made. | Jim is ugly. | Jum's looks don't appeal to me. |

- The words *always, never, ever, whenever, frequently, seldom,* etc. express observations when they are used specifically and in reference to an event or action. They are evaluative/exaggerations when used generally, and will often provoke defensiveness. Be careful speaking in absolutes.
### NVC in Action: "The Most Arrogant Speaker We've Ever Had"
- Marshall recounts a story from a workshop where he gets called arrogant because he hadn't mentioned how it was sometimes difficult for him.
- This antecdote was mostly interesting because I am writing these notes 5 months after having read the book, and I notice that in this interaction, Marshall gets to a response of "that's right", which is a key component in Chris Voss' negotiation strategy in [Never Split the Difference](), which I view as an "Applied NVC" strategy. 
## 4 Identifying and Expressing Feelings
- The second component of NVC is to express how we are feeling.
### The Heavy Cost of Unexpressed Feelings
- I'm tying together a few different texts, but this section essentially highlights the fact that the language, logic, and value/emotional centers in the brain are distinct systems, so often times it can feel difficult to express your feelings logically, or express your feelings and logic in the "right" words. We can work on our vocabulary to give us more tools for expressing feelings.
- Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts. By expressing your vulnerabilities, you can dispel the narrative that the people you are communicating with have built in their head. E.g. People might just be shy, not rude or discriminatory.
### Feelings versus Non-feelings
- The English language allows us to use the word *feel* when we aren't expressing a feeling, but as a substitute for a more appropriate work like *think*. E.g. "I feel like I got a good deal.", should really be, "I think I got a good deal.". 
  - The belief that you got a good deal exists in the rational limbic system, not in the emotional center.
- Feelings are not being clearly expressed when *feel* is followed by:
  1. Words such as that, like, as if - "I feel like a failure." (that's a logical evaluation, not a feeling - "I think I'm a failure expresses the same idea.")
  2. The pronounces I, you, he, she, they, it - "I feel it is useless." 
  3. Names or nouns referring to people - "I feel Amy has been responsible."

  These are all essentially evaluative statements, not expressions of feeling.
- Conversely, it is not necessary at all to use the word *feel* to express a feeling. E.g.
  - I'm feeling irritated
  - I'm irritated
- In NVC we distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are.
  - What we think we are - "I feel inadequate as a student.".
  - Expression of actual feelings 
    - "I feel *disappointed* in myself as a student."
    - "I feel *frustrated* with myself as a student."
    - "I feel *impatient* with myself as a student."

    These statements each express a specific emotion, rather than an evaluation of ability.
- Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or behave toward us.
  1. "I feel unimportant to the people I work with." - This is an evaluation of others' feelings toward you
  2. "I feel misunderstood." - This is an evaluation of the others' level of understanding.
  3. "I feel ignored." - This is an interpretation of the others' actions.

  None of these are actually feelings, and could all be re-worded. E.g. "I think they misunderstood me.", "I think they are ignoring me." - these statements make it clear that you are evaluating actions, not observing feelings.

- Words like ignored express how we interpret others, rather than how we feel. He lists a whole lot of words that people tend to view as feelings, but are actually evaluations of others' behavior (or statuses), such as: abandoned, abused, bullied, cheated, coerced, diminished, let down, manipulated, neglected, overworked, rejected, unappreciated. These aren't feelings, but you can feel sad, insecure, frustrated, angry, etc. as a response to those statuses.
### Building a Vocabulary for Feelings
- It helps to refer to specific emotions rather than vague or general terms like *good* and *bad*.
- **How we are likely to feel when our needs are being met:** absorbed adventurous affectionate alert alive amazed amused animated appreciative ardent aroused astonished blissful breathless buoyant calm carefree cheerful comfortable complacent composed concerned confident contented cool curious dazzled delighted eager ebullient ecstatic effervescent elated enchanted encouraged energetic engrossed enlivened enthusiastic excited exhilarated expansive expectant exultant fascinated free friendly fulfilled glad gleeful glorious glowing good-humored grateful gratified happy helpful hopeful inquisitive inspired intense interested intrigued invigorated involved joyous, joyful jubilant keyed-up loving mellow merry mirthful moved optimistic overjoyed overwhelmed peaceful perky pleasant pleased proud quiet radiant rapturous refreshed relaxed relieved satisfied secure sensitive serene spellbound splendid stimulated surprised tender thankful thrilled touched tranquil trusting upbeat warm wide-awake wonderful zestful 
- **How we are likely to feel when our needs are not being met afraid:** aggravated agitated alarmed aloof angry anguished annoyed anxious apathetic apprehensive aroused ashamed beat bewildered bitter blah blue bored brokenhearted chagrined cold concerned confused cool cross dejected depressed despairing despondent detached disaffected disappointed discouraged disenchanted disgruntled disgusted disheartened dismayed displeased disquieted distressed disturbed downcast downhearted dull edgy embarrassed embittered exasperated exhausted fatigued fearful fidgety forlorn frightened frustrated furious gloomy guilty harried heavy helpless hesitant horrible horrified hostile hot humdrum hurt impatient indifferent intense irate irked irritated jealous jittery keyed-up lazy leery lethargic listless lonely mad mean miserable mopey morose mournful nervous nettled numb overwhelmed panicky passive perplexed pessimistic puzzled rancorous reluctant repelled resentful restless sad scared sensitive shaky shocked skeptical sleepy sorrowful sorry spiritless startled surprised suspicious tepid terrified tired troubled uncomfortable unconcerned uneasy unglued unhappy unnerved unsteady upset uptight vexed weary wistful withdrawn woeful worried wretched

## 5 Taking Responsibility for Our Feelings
People are disturbed not by things, but by the view they take of them. —Epictetus
### Hearing a Negative Message: Four Options
- The third component of NVC is acknowledging the root of our feelings.
- What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but they are not the cause.

**Options**
1. Blame ourselves, accepting the other persons' judgement at great cost to our own self-esteem and self-worth, inclining us toward guilt, shame, and depression.
2. Blame others. When we receive blame this way, we are likely to feel anger and respond in kind.
3. Sense our own feelings and needs, becoming conscious that our feelings of hurt derive from an unmet need
4. Sense others' feelings and needs, asking questions to get at the root of the feelings they are expressing.

- We take responsibility for our feelings, rather than blame other people, by exploring our own needs and expectations. E.g. "You disappointed me by doing X" vs. "I was disappointed you didn't do X, because it made me feel Y"
- Common speech patterns that tend to mask accountability for our own feelings:
  1. Use of impersonal pronouns, like it and that - "That really bugs me"
  2. The expression "I feel X because you/they..."
  3. Statements that mention only the actions of others - "When you don't do X, it makes me feel Y"
- We can take responsibility in each instance by rephrasing these statements as "I feel X because I (need) Y"
  - That really bugs me because I want us to look professional
  - I feel angry that she broke her promise, because I was counting on her to take me to the airport
  - When you don't do your homework I feel disappointed because I want you to learn everything you can.
- Motivation by guilt works by projecting responsibility for your feelings onto others. This basically leads to avoidant behavior, and motivates others' to act out of avoidance rather than genuine motivation. (ref: Meet Me in Hard to Love Places)
### The Needs at the Roots of Feelings
- Judgements, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations of others are all alientated expressions of our own unmet needs.
- When we express needs through evaluation and interpretation, others will likely hear criticism and invest energy in self-defense instead of problem solving.
- If we express our needs, we have a better chance of having them met.
- Needs all humans have:
  - Autonomy - Choosing and planning for your own dreams, goals, and values
  - Celebration - to celebrate life, death, dreams fulfilled
  - Integrity - authenticity, creativity, meaning, self worth
  - Interdependence - acceptance, closeness, love, support, trust, understanding
  - Play - fun, laughter
  - Spirituality - beauty, harmony, inspiration, **order**, peace (*AR: The idea of linking spirituality and order is interesting*)
  - Physical Nurturance - clean air, food, exercise, physical security, rest, sex, shelter, physical touch, water

### The Pain of Expressing Our Needs versus the Pain of Not Expressing Our Needs
- If we don't value our needs, others may not either.
- If you don't express your needs, others will not know what they are.
- This section is also a strong cross reference to Meet Me in Hard to Love Places, which goes much deeper into how childhood experiences shape adaptive behaviors that preclude us from self-expression.
### From Emotional Slavery to Emotional Liberation
1. Emotional Slavery. We see ourselves as responsible for others' feelings.
2. Emotional Revolt. The obnoxious stage. We are aware of the high costs of being responsible for others' feelings and we get angry, and no longer want the responsibility.
3. Emotional Liberation. We take responsibility for our intentions and actions, but not those of others. We respond to the needs of others out of compassion, not guilt, fear or shame. 
### NVC in Action: Bring Back the Stigma of Illegitimacy!


## 6 Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life
- The fourth and final component is about what we would like to request of others in order to enrich life for us.
- How do we express our needs so that others will respond compassionately.
### Using Positive Action Language
- We request what we do what, rather than what we don't. Negative requests are often unclear, and likely to provoke resistance.
- Use positive language when making requests.
- Make requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want.
- Vague language contributes to internal confusion, because each party puts their own spin on things.
- Being "good" (wherein good could be synonymous with compliant or obedient) is rewarded with depression. You are adhering to someone else's values.
### Making Requests Consciously
- If you express a feeling without expressing an action, another party may not understand that you are making a request of them.
- Often times, we aren't consciously aware we are making a request either until we start feeling distressed.
- In this section, the examples of not-really-requests are "Why" statements, like "Why don't you get a haircut?". Chris Voss notes in Never Split the Difference that "why" questions are almost always going to trigger a defensive response. Marshall notes the same thing about these specific examples.
- The clearer we are about what we want, the more likely it is that we'll get it.
### Asking for Reflection
- Asking the listener to reflect back what they heard is a good technique to make sure they received the message *as you intended them to*.
- When the listener provides the reflection, always express appreciation. It will make them less defensive if you need to clarify (because they did not get the message as intended), or for future communications.
- In order to avoid defensive behavior around the ask for reflection, it's useful to provide context - "I'm not testing you, I just want to make sure I expressed myself clearly."
- Empathize with listerns who don't want to reflect back - "Are you saying you feel annoyed because you want respect for your ability to understand things?"
### Requesting Honesty
- Sometimes we want an honest reaction to something we have said. This honesty usually goes one of three ways:
  1. We want to know what feelings have been provoked. "How do you feel about what I just said? What are you reasons for feeling that way?"
  2. We want to know what they are thinking about what was just said (refernence back a few chapters - feel/think are different). "What do you think about what I just said?"
  3. We want to know if the listener will take action based of what we have said. "Would you be willing to do...?"
- NVC requires us to be specific about the type of honesty we want, and make requests in clear, concrete language.
### Making Requests of a Group
- With a group, it's even more important to be clear about the type of honesty you want, because group meetings can easily devolve into unproductive sidetracks. This is a waste of everyone's valuable time.
### Requests versus Demands
- Requests are received as demands when others believe they will be blamed or punish for a failure to comply.
- When you receive a demand, your options are submission or rebellion, and in iether case, the requester is perceived as coercive, limiting the listerner's capacity to respond with compassion.
- The most often a person has been subjected to guilt or other coercive persuasion methods, the more likely they are to interpret requests as demands. People are likely to carry this baggage with them into all relationships, especially if the original dynamic was with a parent.
- To determine if something is a request or demand, see how the person reacts if you don't comply.
  - If it's a demand, the speaker will criticize or judge, followed by a guilt trip.
  - If it's a request, the speaker will empathize with the other's needs while making it, and even if they don't comply.
  - No does not necessarily mean we give up on the request, but we don't engage in persuasion until we have empathized with the whatever is blocking the other person from saying yes. 
    - There is another strong cross-reference to Never Split the Difference, where Voss observes that getting a No's can often be useful tools for clarifying how people feel, and can help lead to Yes.
### Defining Our Objective When Making Requests
- The goal of NVC is to establish a relationship based on honesty and empathy.
- When others trust that our primary concern is the quality of the relationship and fulfilling everyone's needs, they can trust our requests are legitimate, and not demands in disguise.
- Labeling someone (e.g. as socially maladjusted) can become prophetic if they adopt that story as a part of the personal narrative. They behave according to how someone socially maladjusted would behave.
-  "When I tell you what I’d like, I’m not saying that you have to do it or I’ll try to make your life miserable. I don’t know how to say that in a way that you can trust." 
- *Should, supposed to, deserve, justified, etc.* automatically turn requests into demands, because if the other person doesn't comply, then they have (in your mind) committed a moral wrong.

## 7 Receiving Empathetically
### Presence: Don't Just Do Something, Stand There
- Empathy is a respectful understanding of what others are experiencing. Not just listening with the ears or mind, but also with the whole being.
- "In spite of all similarities, every living situation has, like a newborn child, a new face, that has never been before and will never come again. It demands of you a reaction that cannot be prepared beforehand. It demands nothing of what is past. It demands presence, responsibility; it demands you." - Martin Bube
- Instead of offering empathy, we often give advice or reassurance, and explain our own position or feelings. Empathy requires us to focus our full attention on another
  - Side-note, but this is why it's important not to take on other people's baggage if you don't have the space for it. Also be considerate and ask others if they have space before dumping your baggage on them.
  - Ask before offering advice or reassurance. Most people just want empathy and to be heard, and advice and come off as tone deaf. It's best to empathize and then if you want to offer advice, ask for permission first.
- The key ingredient in empathy is being wholly present with the other party. The quality of the prescence is the difference between empathy and either intellectual understanding or sympathy.
  - Intellectual understanding blocks empathy. Intellect sits outside the emotional center.
  - We may choose to sympathize with people by feeling what they are feeling, but that is not the same as empathizing.  
### Listening for Feelings and Needs
- No matter how people are, or what they say, we only hear them when they are observing, feeling, needing, and requesting.
- Listen to what people need rather than what they are thinking. Hear what is going on for them without hearing that you have done anything wrong.
### Paraphrasing
- After we focus on and hear what others are observing, feeling, needing, and requesting, we may wish to reflect back what we heard to confirm our understanding.
- If we have accurately received the other party's message, they will confirm this. If we have not, it gives the speaker an opportunity to correct us.
- NVC suggests using questions that reveal our understanding in order to paraphrase back what you have heard.
- When asking for information, first express our own feelings and needs.
- There is no rule of thumb, but speakers who are expressing intense emotions tend to want them reflected back.
- Only paraphrase if it contributes to greater compassion and understanding. If it doesn't improve the situation, skip it.
- We only feel dehumanized when we get trapped in derogatory images of other people or thoughts of wrongness about ourselves.
### Sustaining Empathy
- When we stay with empathy, we allow speakers to touch deeper levels for themselves.
- We know a speaker has received adequate empathy when tension dissipates and they stop talking about it (or needing to talk about it).
### When Pain Blocks Our Ability to Empathize
- We need empathy to give it, so when we find ourselves unable or unwilling to empathize despite our efforts, it generally means we are too starved for empathy to offer it to others. We don't have enough emotional space.
- "The more faithfully you listen to the voice within you, the better you will hear what is happening outside." -Dag Hammarskjold
- Speaking your feelings nakedly (even if you have to do so loudly) sometimes allows others to hear our need even when they are also in distress. 

## 8 The Power of Empathy
### Empathy That Heals
- Empathy allows us to reset our view of the world and go on with it.
- You don't need to *do* anything, just listen.
- It's harder to empathize with those who appear to be in a position of status or power over us, because requests and needs can be perceived as criticism or demands.
### Empathy and the Ability to Be Vulnerable
- The more we empathize with others, the safer we will feel ourselves. 
- You say alot with your actions, including listening closely and actively. It communicates that no matter what the other party says, you will translate it into needs and feelings.
### Using Empathy to Defuse Danger
- Don't say "but" to an angry person. Instead empathize with what they are feeling and let them get it out and re-humanize themselves. 
- The closer the person is to you emotionally, the more difficult it may be to empathize.
### Empathy in Hearing Someone's "No!"
- Empathizing with a "no" protects us from taking it personally. "No" is almost never about us personally.
### Empathy to Revive a Lifeless Conversation
- People are not aware that empathy is often what they are needing.
- To bring a conversation back to life interrupt with empathy.  Express your desire to connect - "I'm feeling impatient because I'd like to be more connected, and this conversation is not creating the kind of connection I am wanting. How are you feeling about the conversation?"
- What bores the listener generally bores the speaker (and other listerners!) too.
- Speakers prefer listeners interrupt instead of being bored and pretending. Interruption is a form of engagement.
### Empathy for Silence
- Respond to others' silence with the same type of questioning, listening for feelings and needs.

## 9 Connecting Compassionately with Ourselves
*Let us become the change we seek in the world.* —Mahatma Gandhi
- NVC's most important use may be to develop self-compassion and self-care.
### Remembering the Specialness of What We Are
We use NVC to evaluate ourselves in ways that engender growth rather than self-hatred.
###  Evaluating Ourselves When We've Been Less Than Perfect
When we use the word "should" with ourselves we resist learning, because should implies a lack of choice. Human beings react violently to any demands or threats to autonomy - it's a form of internal tyranny. Don't should yourself!
### Translating Self-judgements and Inner Demands
- If the person we are judging happens to be ourselves, what we are saying is, “I myself am not behaving in harmony with my own needs.”
- Our challenge when we are doing things that are no enriching is to evaluate ourselves in a way that encourages us to change the direction we want to go out of self-compassion rather than guilt or shame for what we *should* be doing. 
- Self-judgments (like all judgments) are expressions of unmet needs.
### NVC Mourning
- Connecting with the feelings and unmet needs stimulated by past actions we now regret.
- When we find ourselves reprimanding ourselves, we can ask "What unment need of mine is being expressed through this judgment?"
  - By connecting to the need, we will notice a remarkable shift in our we feel
  - Whether it's sadness, frustration, guilt, or otherwise - the purpose of these feelings is to motivate and mobilize us to fulfill that need.
  - Regret can hurt, but ultimately it helps us learn from what we have done without requiring blame or self-hatred. We see how our behavior did not align with our needs and values, and we accept the feelings that come with that awareness.
  - We we are focused on the need, our mindset shifts toward one that is creatively focused on meeting the need, rather than judging or punish it.
### Self-forgiveness
- Self-forgiveness happens when empathetic connection is made - when we listen to our own needs. It allows us to see how our choices are an attempt to fulfill life, even as mourning/regret teaches us how we have fallen short.
- Self-compassion requires us to empathetically hold both the self that regrets the past action and the self that took the action. We have to connect the old self with the new self so that they aren't fighting or judging each other.
- Connecting with the need we were trying to meet when we took the action that we now regret.
### The Lesson of the Polka-dotted Suit
- Marshall relays a story where he ruined a suit, but discovered that ultimately he was upset because he had failed to take proper time to care for himself and his needs.
- We are compassionate with ourselves when we are able to embrace all parts of ourselves and recognize the needs and values expressed by each part.
### Don't Do Anything That Isn't Play!
- An important form of self-compassion is making choices motivated purely by our desire to contribute to life, rather than out of a feeling of obligation or compliance (or to not be hassled!).
- When we are conscious of the life-enriching purpose of our actions then even hard work has an element of play to it.
- We want to take action of out the desire to contribute to life, not out of fear, guilt, shame, or obligation.
### Translating "Have to" to "Choose to"
1. Identify things you do in life that you don't experience as playful and create a list. Avoid focusing on judgments, this is a space for honest reflection.
2. After the list is compiled, acknowledge that you don't have to do these things, but rather you choose to. Say "I choose to..." in front of each item. 
3. After saying the activity, follow with "...because I want...". E.g. "I choose to work a 9-5 job, because I want to make enough money to provide for my family."
4. Now that you have identified your primary motiviation for choosing to do non-playful things, you can go about creatively finding other avenues to meet the underlying need.

For every choice you make, be conscious of what need it serves.
### Cultivating Awareness of the Engery behind Our Actions
- As we go through the previous exercise, we may find that the rewards we are chasing are extrinsic - money, approval, escaping punishment, avoiding shame or guilt, to satisfy a sense of duty.
  - "I find it tragic that we work so hard to buy love and assume that we must deny ourselves and do for others in order to be liked. In fact, when we do things solely in the spirit of enhancing life, we will find others appreciating us. Their appreciation, however, is only a feedback mechanism confirming that our efforts had the intended effect. The recognition that we have chosen to use our power to serve life and have done so successfully brings us the genuine joy of celebrating ourselves in a way that approval from others can never offer."
  - Most people pay taxes to avoid punishment, but those who lived in worse/more corrupt countries may feel pride in submitting their taxes, feeling that they are contributing to something greater.
  - The most dangerous behavior is doing something "because we are supposed to". That is essentially surrendering your free will.
- Be aware of actions motivated by extrinsic rewards and know the price you pay for them.

The most crucial application of NVC may be in the way we treat ourselves. When we make mistakes, instead of getting caught up in moralistic self-judgments, we can use the process of NVC mourning and self-forgiveness to show us where we can grow. By assessing our behaviors in terms of our own unmet needs, the impetus for change comes not out of shame, guilt, anger, or depression, but out of the genuine desire to contribute to our own and others’ well-being. We also cultivate self-compassion by consciously choosing in daily life to act only in service to our own needs and values rather than out of duty, for extrinsic rewards, or to avoid guilt, shame, and punishment. If we review the joyless acts to which we currently subject ourselves and make the translation from “have to” to “choose to,” we will discover more play and integrity in our lives.

## 10 Expressing Anger Fully
- Simply hurting people is too superficial. If we are truly angry, we would want a more powerful, impactful way to express ourselves. 
- NVC isn't about supressing or ignoring anger, but rather expresing it fully and wholeheartedly
### Distinguishing Stimulus From Cause
- The first step to expressing anger with NVC is to separate the other person from the responsibility for our anger (as with any other feeling, it is only our responsibility)
- We are never angry because of what others do or say. We get to choose how we feel, regardless of the other person.
- Equating stimulus and cause is a good way to motivate by guilt - the other person will "know" that they can relieve suffering by changing their actions, ergo they either change or they are morally bad for creating suffering.
- The cause of anger lies in our thinking - blame and judgement.
### All Anger Has a Life-serving Core
- All anger and judgment as life-alienating, violence-provoking thinking. He's kind of squirrelly in his language here, but I believe that is his way of acknowledging that sometimes it is justified. 
- Ultimately, he expresses that he would rather focus on the need than the feeling of anger, becuase focusing on the anger makes it unlikely that the need will be met.
- At the core of all anger is a need that is not being fulfilled
- Use anger as a wake-up call - "I am angry because I am needing...", not "I am angry because they...".
- Anger diverts our energy and attention to retribution or punishment, rather than meeting needs.
- The same action can provoke different responses, depending on our labeling/framing of the person who took it. E.g. If a kid perceived as spoiled or mean spills a drink, they will be castigated. If a kid perceived as weak or frail did the same thing, they would likely receive more compassion.
### Stimulus versus Cause: Practical Implications
- When we become aware of our needs, anger gives way to life-serving feelings.
- Violence comes from the belief that other people cause our pain and therefore deserve punishment or retribution. We cause our own pain when we disconnect from our feelings and needs.
- Judgments of others contribute to self-fulfilling prophecies. They will adopt the judgment as a label and frame.
### Four Steps to Expressing Anger
1. Stop. Breathe. 
2. Identify our judgmental thoughts. 
3. Connect with our needs. 
4. Express our feelings and unmet needs.
### Offering Empathy First
- It will often be difficult for others' to hear us until they themselves have been heard, so it can be useful to offer empathy first, in order to trigger reciprocation.
- The more we hear them, the more they'll hear us.
- Stay conscious of the violent thoughts that arise in our minds, without judging them.
- When we hear another person's feelings and needs, we recognize our common humanity.
- Our need is for the other person to truly hear our pain, not to assign blame to someone for causing the pain. We want them to know they hurt us, and acknowledge the legitimacy of those feelings. Blaming only provides a hollow, unsatisfying (and temporary) release valve.
- People do not hear our pain when they believe they are at fault. If we sense blame entering their mind, we may need to slow down, go back, and hear their pain some more.
### Taking Our Time
- It might feel weird to switch from our ingrained, automatic behaviors. If we want to live a conscious, harmonious life, then we'll want to take our time.
- Practice translating each judgment into an unmet need. Most of us were raised in violence, unlearning those behaviors requires practice.

## 11 Conflict Resolution and Mediation
### Human Connection
- Creating a connection between people is the most important thing.
- The goal is to craft strategies to help resolve conflict to both sides' satisfaction (not compromise - no one is happy with compromises). With NVC our objective is to meet everyones' needs.
### NVC Conflict Resolution versus Traditional Meditation
- Again, NVC encourages the creation of human connection, expression of feeling and needs, rather than focusing on the specific issues at hand. 
- Instead of trying to reach an agreement, it's more crucial to create a framework for all future agreements in the form of trust, connection, and empathy.
- When you make the connection, the problem usually solves itself.
### NVC Conflict Resolution Steps - a quick overview
1. Express our needs
2. Search teh real needs of the other person (regardless of how they are being expressed)
3. Verify both parties accurately recognize each others' needs. If not, continue to seek meaning.
4. Provide as much empathy as needed to hear each other accurately.
5. Propose strategies for resolving the conflict using positive action language. Avoid language that implies wrongness
### On Needs, Strategies, and Analysis
- Intellectual analysis is often received as criticism. 
- Learn to hear needs regardless of how people express them.
- Criticism and diagnosis get in the way of peaceful conflict resolution.
- Instead of saying "they are", say "I need" or "I feel"
### Empathy to East the Pain that Prevents Hearing
- People often need empathy before they are able to hear what is being said. If your message isn't getting through, try taking a step back an empathizing more.
### Using Present and Positive Action Language to Resolve Conflict
- Use present and positive action language. Statements that express a feeling or need *in this moment* and a positive description of the action being requested.
### Using Action Verbs
- Use concise action language to describe what you are asking for. Avoid vague statements like "Give me freedom to grow" or "I'd like you to listen to me when I talk to you.". Any statement that can be responded to with "I already do that" is probably too open to interpretation.
- Maintain respect is key.
### Translating "No"
- Again, cross-reference to Never Split the Difference. "No" is often an important mile marker on the road to "That's Right". It helps clarify what people aren't open to or comfortable with.
### NVC and the Mediator Role
- It's not about us. The goal of mediation is not to impose our will on the parties, but to create a connection so that they have a framework to resolve their own issues based on feelings and needs.
- Keep things moving, make sure everyone has a chance to speak, slow down the process when things get heated and confirm that everyone is still hearing each other correctly (to avoid energy-wasting tangents), keep it present.
- Role play can help speed things up as a quick way to give each party in the others' perspective.
- Interrupting is an important task to keep the communication on focus and maintain the process.
### When People Say "No" to Meeting Face to Face
- If the parties refuse to meet (thus preventing a connection) role playing with each party individually can be a useful tactic.
### Informal Meditation: Sticking Our Nose in Other People's Business
- If we are going to stick our nose in other peoples' conflicts, we need to be well practiced at hearing the need in any message.

## 12 The Protective Use of Force
### When the Use of Force is Unavoidable
- NVC requires us to distinguish between the protective and punitive uses of force.
### The Thinking behind the Use of Force
- The intention behind the protective use of force is only to protect, not to punish, blame, or condemn.
- We are focusing on life or rights of those we want to protect without passing judgment on either party. The assumption is that people behave injuriously as a result of: a lack of awareness, ignorance of the consequences, a belief in the moral righteousness of their actions, or delusional thinking (i.e. voices in your head).
- This behavior requires the use of force as a protective and corrective measure, not intended to punish.
- Punitive actions are designed to make people suffer enough to see the error of their ways, repent, and change. In practice, this more often results in hostility and resentment instead.
### Types of Punitive Force
- Physical punishment. Fear of physical punishment obscures childrens' awareness of the compassion underlying the demands of the parents.
- Judgment labeling and the witholding of privileges.
- Discrediting or blame. 
- Withdrawl of care, love, or respect.
### The Costs of Punishment
- When we fear punishment, we focus on consequences instead of our values.
- Fear of punishment diminishes self-esteem, goodwill, and altruism.
### Two Questions that Reveal the Limitations of Punishment
1. What do I want this person to do?
2. What do I want this person's reasons to be for doing it?

If you want someone do something for intrinsic reasons, punishment is folly.
### The Protective Use of Force in Schools
Marshall describes a mediation he did at a school for kids with behavioral issues. He NVC'd some of the students to come up with the idea for a "do-nothing room", which was basically a study hall/therapy session for kids who just didn't feel like focusing at the moment. This decreased classroom disruptions, which increased the amount of respect the students showed in the classroom (since the environment was now more orderly). This effort succeeded because the students came up with the idea and propagated the frame of it being a protective environment rather than a punitive one.

## 13 Liberating Ourselves and Counseling Others
This whole chapter cross-references to Meet Me in Hard to Love Places.
### Freeing Ourselves From Old Programming
- We can liberate ourselves from cultural conditioning using NVC techniques to build awareness of when this conditioning is preventing us from being conscious of our needs.
- We have inherited a language that served kings and powerful elites in domination societies. We need to craft new language for a more empathetic and egalitarian society.

   "The masses, discouraged from developing awareness of their own needs, have instead been educated to be docile and subservient to authority. Our culture implies that needs are negative and destructive; the word needy applied to a person suggests inadequacy or immaturity. When people express their needs, they are often labeled selfish, and the use of the personal pronoun I is at times equated with selfishness or neediness."
### Resolving Internal Conflicts
- When we have a judgmental dialogue going on within our minds, we become alienated from what we are needing and can't act to meet those needs.
- Depression indicates a state of alienation from our own needs.
- Take an "NVC pill" and restate self-judgmental messages as "When a, I feel b, because I need c. Therefore I now would like d."
  - Consider the following statements - "I should do something more with my life. I'm wasting my education and talents." and "You’re being unrealistic. You’re a mother of two children and can’t handle that responsibility, so how can you handle anything else?"
  - With NVC, these become "When I spend as much time at home with the children as I do without practicing my profession, I feel depressed and sicouraged because I am needing the fulfillment I get from my career. Therefore, I now would like to find part-time work to continue developing my career.
  - Now isntead of a series of judgments, it's a series of feelings and needs, followed by a self-request with a specific action.
- The ability to hear our own feelings and needs and empathize with them can free us from depression
### Caring for Our Inner Environment
- Often times, we are most violent towards ourselves.
- Focus on what we want to do rather than what went wrong.
- Diffuse your stress by hearing your own feelings and needs, and by empathizing with others.
### Replacing Diagnosis with NVC
I don't have any major notes for this section. He basically wants to avoid diagnosing people with conditions, and focus on what they are feeling and needing, and making sure they feel heard. People generally don't need a diagnosis, they just need empathetic communication.

<blockquote>
… the more you become a connoisseur of gratitude, the less you are a victim of resentment, depression, and despair. Gratitude will act as an elixir that will gradually dissolve the hard shell of your ego—your need to possess and control—and transform you into a generous being. The sense of gratitude produces true spiritual alchemy, makes us magnanimous—large souled. —Sam Keen, philosopher

## 14 Expressing Appreciating in Nonviolent Communication
### The Intention behind the Appreciation
- Compliments are often judgments of others, even though they are positive. They express a judgment without expressing a feeling. Praise is a form of extrinsic motivation, so ideally, you don't want people to be acting in order to receive praise, that's a perverse incentive.
- Express appreciation to celebrate, not manipulate.
### The Three Components of Appreciation
- NVC clearly distinguishes three components in the expression of appreciation: 
  1. The actions that have contributed to our well-being 
  2. The particular needs of ours that have been fulfilled 
  3. The pleasureful feelings engendered by the fulfillment of those needs
- Saying "thank you" in NVC: "This is what you did; this is what I feel; this is the need of mine that was met"
  - bad e.g. "Marshall, you are brilliant!"
  - good e.g. “Marshall, when you said these two things (showing me her notes), I felt very hopeful and relieved, because I’ve been searching for a way to make a connection with my son, and these gave me the direction I was looking for.”
  - You don't learn anything from the first example, you learn a lot from the second one
### Receiving Appreciation
- We fret over whether we deserve appreciation or about the expectations that come with it.
- We are accustomed to a culture where commerce and deserving are standard modes of interchange, we are often uncomfortable with simple giving and receiving.
- "I kiss the God in you that allows you to give us what you did." - Gratitude of the Sufi Muslims
- Instead of ego or false humility, it conveys a clear sense of appreciation.
- "Don't be so humble, you're not that great." -Golda Meir demonstrating peak Israeli.
- Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. 
   It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us. You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
   We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us, it is in everyone.
   And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
   As we are liberated from our fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

   - Marianne Williamson

### The Hunger for Appreciation
- Despite our unease in receiving appreciate, we crave genuine recognition and appreciation. 
- What appreciation might someone give you that would leave you jumping for joy?
- We often continually search for improvements while barely stopping to celebrate things that are going well. We tend to notice what's wrong rather than what's right.
- Try to be more aware of what enriches our life and refine our skills in expressing gratitude.
### Overcoming the Reluctance to Express Appreciation
- People like to be appreciated for stuff. Do you like to be genuinely appreciated? Of course you do, and you are human, so why wouldn't everyone else?
- Even if you are sure you will do a poor job of expressing your feelings, if they are heartfelt, do it anyways. Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.
